# Week 12

In week 12 we will continue to work on the [SeeMore project](see-more.md), in which the students will create a RESTful web API from a public or private data source, and learn to work within a larger Agile team.

## Goals
- local User creation via OAuth service
- push to authorized services via APIs
- increasing comfort with API interactions
- increasing professional comportment and team project skills
- focus on project "polish" and customer deliverables

**Homework**

- Watch the [ActionMailer Railscast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/206-action-mailer-in-rails-3)
- Watch the [Resque Railscast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/271-resque)

*Note*: This screencast uses Rails 3, but everything is pretty much exactly the same.

*Note Two*: We will be doing lessons on both of these topics on tuesday, you can choose to watch these screencasts before or after the lessons, but I encourage you to watch them before **and** after the lesson.
