**Homework**

- Watch the [ActionMailer Railscast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/206-action-mailer-in-rails-3)
- Watch the [Resque Railscast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/271-resque)

*Note*: This screencast uses Rails 3, but everything is pretty much exactly the same.

*Note Two*: We will be doing lessons on both of these topics on tuesday, you can choose to watch these screencasts before or after the lessons, but I encourage you to watch them before **and** after the lesson.
