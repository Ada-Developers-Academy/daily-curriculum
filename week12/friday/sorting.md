# Why Do We Care?

>“A common conjecture is that computers around the world spend the majority of their time sorting. Hence, it is difficult to talk much about computer science without talking about sorting. There are many sorting approaches.”

Sorting questions are some of the most common in technical interviews. Why?

## To See how you think about a problem 
- Can you break it into smaller pieces?
- What questions do you ask?
- Do you plan things out, or dive in and experiment?

## Basic programming skills
- Loops
- Comparisons
- Recursion

## Professional skills
- Self analysis
- Able to articulate more than one solution to a problem, and understand trade-offs between them

## Communication Skills
- Ability to have a discussion about your own work
    + Remember -- **"You are not your code"**


# Sorts!

## Selection Sort


1. Start with the entire list marked as unprocessed.
1. Find the smallest element in the yet unprocessed list; swap it with the element that is in the first position of the unprocessed list.
1. Repeat step 2 for an additional n – 2 times for the remaining n – 1 numbers in the list. After n – 1 iterations, the nth element, by definition, is the largest and is in the correct location.

### Complexity
+ O(n<sup>2</sup>)

### "But Kerri, That's AWFUL!"

...maybe. Selection Sort is always the same, regardless of the data. While it takes O(n<sup>2</sup>) operations to sort the data, it only has to perform O(n) swaps. Why might this be desirable?
