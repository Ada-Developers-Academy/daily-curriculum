# Week 23

In Week 23 we continue [capstone projects](../capstone/capstone.md). In this week
we will have guest lectures on relevant topics for a wide variety of capstone
requirements. Students will have frequent checkins with an instructor to ensure
the project is on track, review stories, and consult on any problems.

## Goals

- Begin final features of Capstone
- Evaluate features that may be cut
