# Week 21

In Week 21 we continue [capstone projects](../capstone/capstone.md). In this week
we will have guest lectures on relevant topics for a wide variety of capstone
requirements. Students will have frequent checkins with an instructor to ensure
the project is on track, review stories, and consult on any problems.

## Goals

+ Continue development of Capstone project
+ Discover gaps in learning and identify resources to fill them in
+ Code!
