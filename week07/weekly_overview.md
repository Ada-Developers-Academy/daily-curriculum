# Week 7

In week 7 we will focus on reinforcing the major components of Rails, seen in this [rails stack diagram](resources/rails-request-cycle.pdf). Each day we will have a lecture on a piece in order of the request cycle. We will also be working on [Betsy](resources/betsy.md), an online webstore for independent merchants to sell their goods. At the end of the week students will have learned and practiced the rails stack.
