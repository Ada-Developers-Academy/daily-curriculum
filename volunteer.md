##Ways you can be involved
- **Teaching Assistant** - Helping students problem solve/learn in the classroom
- **Guest Lecturer** - Speak to a specific topic or tool
- **Code Reviewer** - Provide students with comments/code reviews either in person or remotely
- **Application Reviewer** - Review candidate application submissions and score
- **Mentor** (from a sponsoring company) - Provide regular professional/techincal support for a specific student

###Teaching Assistant
As a TA, you will be asked to help students during project time.

Your role will be to:
- provide expertise knowledge to students on why/when/how coding structures are used to solve a problem
- help students get "unstuck" by asking them probing questions, providing suggestions, and scaffolding the process of solving a problem
- provide specific feedback to students their code and problem solving approach
- encourage and support students on their journey to being professional developers

Your knowledge and expertise as a seasoned programmer is invaluable to our students. We ask that you model your thinking to students by not just giving them the answers, but by asking them leading questions that help them find the solution with your guidance. Remember that our students are completely new to coding and that your support and guidance will help them achieve quicker and with more success!

If there is down time while volunteering at Ada, you are more than welcome to work on projects of your own, but please ensure that students know that you are still available and that they are not "bugging you" when they ask for help.

###Guest Lecturer
As a Guest Lecturer, you will provide training to students on coding skills/tools and/or soft skills.

Your role will be to:
- know your audience is a group of women who are new to coding; please define terms, do not assume that they know something already, and do not refer to concepts as something that "programmers should already know" or as something that "you can't get a job if you don't understand"
- prepare an interactive presentation for our students that broadens their skill set or increases their awareness of topics related to the tech industry
- if your lecture is teaching a tool or skill, scaffold the lecture so that students are first presented with an intro to the topic and smaller problem; build to more challenging problems after guided instruction and walkthrough of how to solve the problem; providing plenty of simpler examples and problems is a perk
- field questions at the end of the lecture and  provide resources for students who are interested in learning more

You bring expertise to our classroom that gives students the ability to learn more and do more. A diverse collection of guest lecturers allows each student to find specific topics that they are passionate about and also provide assistance to our instructors by covering topics they may not be familiar with/have the time to prepare for.

### Code Reviewer
As a Code Reviewer, you will assess the quality of students' code and provide feedback to them. This can be done in person or remotely.

####[Code Review Process](rubrics/code_review_process.md)

Your role will be to:
- read the provided assignment description and grading rubric
- assign a "level" to the student's code -- beginner, proficient, or master -- for each of the categories on the rubric
- leave encouraging, as well as constructive, comments/suggestions/feedback to students

### Application Reviewer

### Mentor (Designated representative from Sponsoring Company)
As a Mentor, you will provide 1-on-1 support to specific Ada students.

Your role will be to:
-	Provide 1-on-1 technical and professional guidance to a designated Ada student
-	Meet with student at regular intervals, preferably once per week (at the start at Ada, later at the Job Site)
-	Be available for non-mentee support in the classroom (this provides ability to meet more students)
-	Be available for email or phone questions from mentee

You create an emotional tie with our students and help support them on a deeper and very meaningful level. You provide students with weekly support that encourages them to survive an emotionally intense career change.
