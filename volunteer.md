###Teaching Assistant
As a TA you will be asked to help students during project time.

Your role will be to:
- provide expertise knowledge to students on why/when/how coding structures are used to solve a problem
- help students get "unstuck" by asking them probing questions, providing suggestions, and scaffolding the process of solving a problem
- provide specific feedback to students their code and problem solving approach
- encourage and support students on their journey to being professional developers

Your knowledge and expertise as a seasonal programmer is invaluable to our students. We ask that you model your thinking to students by not just giving them the answers, but by asking them leading questions that help them find the solution with your guidance. Remember that our students are completely new to coding and that your support and guidance will help them achieve quicker and with more success!
