Blake Johnson, a lover of language and logic, lives in Capitol Hill, Seattle. After growing up in Denver, she graduated Summa Cum Laude from Duke University where she studied English, Spanish and film— and did a little sketch comedy on the side. Blake went on to do marketing for local farmers markets in New York while earning her MSSE in English Education. Before pursuing programming, Blake taught high school students to read, write and think critically. When she’s not thinking of new applications to write in Ruby, Blake cooks, runs marathons and reads the thickest novels she can find.
