Dice Set
========
Implement a Dice class that passes the spec provided. Run the spec by running ```rspec``` from *daily_curriculum/examples/week4/dice* (Note that you may also need to run ```gem install nyan-cat-formatter```)

The spec should all fail, complaining about 6 errors - this is expected! No need to be alarmed or overwhelmed. Read through the spec file (in *spec/lib/dice_spec.rb*) to get a sense of what it expects our Dice class to do, and address the failing specs one at a time.
