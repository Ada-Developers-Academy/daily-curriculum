# Week 4

In Week 4 we introduce introduce Test-Driven Development (TDD) and basic networking concepts. We will spend 2 days exploring TDD and the rspec toolset through building our own testing projects and tests. We then pivot into an introduction of the "plumbing" of the Internet and how clients such as web browsers communicate with servers. We build a pair of applications using the streamlined website framework *Sinatra* to begin exploring HTTP response cycles and basic Model-View-Control (MVC) techniques through building and deploying a blog.

## Goals
- Introduced to basic TDD concepts
    - rspec
    - how to write a test
    - becoming comfortable writing code against a spec
- Learn basic architecture of the Internet
- Learn the HTTP response cycle
- Build a personal blog in Sinatra
- Grow skills in reading technical documentation by working with the Sinatra: Up and Running book
- Gain exposure to deployment via Heroku
-
