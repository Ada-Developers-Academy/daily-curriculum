# Week 4

In Week 4 we introduce introduce Test-Driven Development (TDD) and basic networking concepts. We will spend 2 days exploring TDD and the rspec toolset through building our own testing projects and tests. We then pivot into an introduction of the "plumbing" of the Internet and how clients such as web browsers communicate with servers. We build a pair of applications using the streamlined website framework *Sinatra* to begin exploring HTTP response cycles and basic Model-View-Control (MVC) techniques through building and deploying a blog.
