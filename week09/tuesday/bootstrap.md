# Bootstrap

Bootstrap is an open source project started by Twitter. It is a front-end HTML, CSS,
 & Javascript framework. It provides tools and standards for creating common web elements.
One of it's main features is a responsive (different size screens) grid system. But it also
includes things like default styles for common elements, icons, and even javascript features
such as modals, tooltips, and image slideshows.

Installation
------------
There are many ways to install bootstrap, it is possible to use Less or Sass to compile
the CSS on the fly, this allows you to change the defaults within bootstrap by simply
changing variables. There is a ruby gem which enables this but we're going to take the
easy way out and just download the raw CSS. Go to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download)
and click on the "Download Bootstrap" button. This will download all of the CSS, JS, and fonts.
