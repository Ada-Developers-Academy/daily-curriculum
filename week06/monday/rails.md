What Happened?
==============

The Rails gem includes a command-line tool ```rails``` that has a number of options. With it we can start a server, quickly create new classes, or work with the database, among others. The command ```new``` creates a new directory and creates all the subdirectories and files a Rails application needs to have in order to get started.

Starting A Rails Server
=======================

<pre>$ rails server</pre>

This command starts the default web server ```WEBrick``` which we can access at http://localhost:3000 on our computer. It will display the output of the log, showing all the errors, warnings, and notifications generated by the app, all the DB queries, and some basic timing information. Let's take a look at that!
