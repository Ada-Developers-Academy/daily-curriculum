## Exploratory Project

In our exploratory project we will be allowing students to define their own feature and focus requirements. In this project we will not be focusing on specific feature sets, but rather on "completeness". You are free to use the language and framework of your choosing. You are also free to make the project as small or large as you desire.

Part of the focus is learning time management and expectations.

#### Requirments

- Time management and expectations, choose a project that will fit with your availability over the two week period.
- Must be an application (no completely static HTML sites)
- Must be "complete"*
    - Polished HTML
    - Refactored code
    - No broken links or paths
    - Good test coverage
    - Presentable
    - End user should never be confused or think "that's weird..."
    
* You don't need to implement all of these things, just the ones you do, fully implement them. For example, you don't need to test your application, but if you have decided to test your app, make sure the test are full and clean.

#### Ideas

Sometimes it's difficult to think of *what* to build, so here are a few ideas of apps that you could build. Here are some ideas to build if you're running into coders block.

**Holiday Reads** (Difficulty 4/5)

Use the Google Book API (https://developers.google.com/books/) to create an application where a user can: 
- create an account
- search for and add friends by entering the user's email address or name

- search for books by author or title
- add a book to their wish list and/or completed list
- share a book with a friend
- view a leader board that compares their number of books completed versus their friends and everyone
