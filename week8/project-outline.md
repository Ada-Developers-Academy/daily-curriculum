## Exploratory Project

In our exploratory project we will be allowing students to define their own feature and focus requirements. In this project, we will _not_ focus on specific feature sets, but rather on completeness. You get to decide what features you want to build and the size of the scale/scope of your project. Whatever you decide, the application should be production-ready and polished, ready to share with your classmates when you arrive back from break. 

You are free to use the language and framework of your choosing. You are also free to make the project as small or large as you desire. One of your focuses should be time management and setting realistic expectations.

#### Requirments

- Time management and expectations; choose a project that will fit with your availability over the two-week period
- Must be an application (no completely static HTML sites)
- Must be "complete" (where applicable)
    - Polished HTML 
    - Refactored code
    - No broken links or paths
    - Good test coverage
    - Presentable
    - End user should never be confused or think "that's weird..."

#### Ideas

Sometimes it's difficult to think of *what* to build, so here are a few ideas of apps that you could build:

**Holiday Reads** (Difficulty 4/5)

Use the [Google Book API](https://developers.google.com/books/) to create an application where a user can: 
- create an account
- search for and add friends by entering friend's email address or name
- search for books by author or title
- add a book to own wish list and/or completed list
- share a book with a friend
- view a leader board that compares own number of books completed versus friends and everyone
