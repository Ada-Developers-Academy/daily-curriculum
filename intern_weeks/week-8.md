### Open Work

Work on anything that you would like

### Language Primer
Write a primer for future students who may be learning the language and/or frameworks
that you are currently learning. Include:

- Layperson introduction with some of the specs, strengths, and use cases
- Resources for installation and getting started
- "Hello World" tutorial of the language
- A list of common problems or errors that were difficult to understand or find solutions (be very specific)
- Anything that you wish someone would have told you before you started.

To get started clone the Ada [repo](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/primers).
Create a new markdown file for the topic that you want to write about, the name
of the file should be descriptive of what you are covering `python-django.md`.
Feel free to push your file up at any time. If there are conflicts in file names,
then please rename your file being more specific or simply putting a `-2` at the end.
