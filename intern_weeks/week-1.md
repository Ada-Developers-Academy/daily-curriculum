### Open Source Contributions

To give back to the community and to help keep up on code, try to identify an open 
source opportunity that you can work on. Start by reading 
[8 simple steps for contributing to open source](http://www.sitepoint.com/8-simple-steps-for-contributing-to-open-source/).
Then try to find a project to work on, which can be difficult, here are some ways to get started:

1. [Code Triage](http://www.codetriage.com/) is a great tool to help search for projects (by language and author).
2. Find a suitable bug or request on [Github Issues](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation) for a tool that you work with
3. If you ever wished "Geee... I wish gem X did Z", that may be a good oppurtunity to communicate with the author to determine if this would be a desirable feature.
4. Whenever you experience a plain ol' bug in a gem, fix it and submit a pull request.

If you find a project that would allow for multiple contributors or pairing, share with everyone else.
