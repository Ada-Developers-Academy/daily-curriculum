|4:00 - 5:00 | Week 3 Retrospective          |

This week will will spend most of our time doing three things:

1. Review Apps for good apps.
    - Each student should review 12 additional apps (or until all apps have at least 3 reviews)
    - Two groups of three should tackle the technical submissions together.
2. Taking time to expand our knowledge through focused work, we will often have time on Thursdays for this kind of thing, ongoing ideas are totally acceptable here:
    - Meet with other who are learning that same new language as you
        - Code review any open source code from your company (keep you NDA in mind)
        - Code review personal projects
        - Start a small project together, this could be a Hello World app or something to work on over the course of your entire internship
    - Identify and contribute to an open source project
    - Begin or continue a personal project
3. Meeting with an instructor to review your internship experience. Plan to talk about:
    - Issues that you see arising
    - Your understanding of your role as a developer
    - The technical problems you face
    - Your contributions so far
    
**One on ones will be during the other activities*

**REMINDER** Headcount for luncheon.
