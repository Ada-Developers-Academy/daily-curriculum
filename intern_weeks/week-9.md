### Language Primer
Write a primer for future students who may be learning the language and/or frameworks
that you are currently learning. Today the following minimum will be due:

- Layperson introduction with some of the specs, strengths, and use cases
- Install guide and/or notes on expected preinstalled tools (only for dependencies)
- "Hello World" (or equivalent) tutorial
- A link to the official docs and at least 3 other resources

To get started clone the Ada [repo](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/primers).
Create a new markdown file for the topic that you want to write about, the name
of the file should be descriptive of what you are covering `python-django.md`.
Feel free to push your file up at any time. If there are conflicts in file names,
then please rename your file being more specific or simply putting a `-2` at the end.
