### Interviews
Bookis and Elise are going to be in cohort 2 interviews until 3:30. We'll have interviewees
coming into the classroom, so feel free to chat - but don't divulge any secrets! ;)  
Otherwise, please get started on the Open Source Project:

### Open Source Project
Over the next 6 weeks, you'll be spending the majority of your Ada class time
contributing to an open source project of your choice. This project is meant to give
you some dedicated time to work on and give back to the OSS community (without OSS,
  we wouldn't have been able to teach Ruby in class)!

#### Project Deliverables
- Depending on the size/scope of the contribution, submit a minimum of one pull request
to an OSS project or library no later than 8/27.
- Complete 3 blog posts about the project: one due this week (selecting/starting OSS project),
one due 8/6 (check in on progress), and one due at the completion of the project on 8/27
(retrospective).
- Prepare a 5 minute talk about the project/library and your contribution
to present during Cohort 2's first week of class (9/2-9/5).

#### Choosing a Project
Read [8 simple steps for contributing to open source](http://www.sitepoint.com/8-simple-steps-for-contributing-to-open-source/).
Then, try to find at least one project that's interesting and needs help. (At least  
one because you may want to have a couple of options if one goes nowhere). If you
find a project that would allow for multiple contributors or pairing, share! If you've
already been contributing to an open source project and would like to continue, you are welcome
to do so.

Check out the below tools to get started:

1. [Code Triage](http://www.codetriage.com/) and [Open Hatch](https://openhatch.org) are great tools to help search for projects.
2. Find a suitable bug or request on [Github Issues](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2)
3. If you ever wished "Geee... I wish gem X did Z", that may be a good opportunity to
communicate with the author about adding the feature. Occasionally, libraries will have
contribution protocols in the project README.
4. Experienced a plain ol' bug in a gem? Fix it and submit a pull request.
5. Advice from the internet:  
  [RubyGems Adoption Center](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rubygems-org/niS5ZO9DNgk/SHUzS-8Qx68J)  
  [RailsBridge's BridgeTroll project](https://github.com/railsbridge/bridge_troll/issues)  
  Django: [Andrew from Foundry](https://twitter.com/marginoferror) has offered to help anyone interested in contribution.  
  KDE and GNOME projects: [Ian](https://twitter.com/redbluemagenta) can help get you started.  

#### Due Friday
Write about your experience searching for an OSS project and submit [URL to Canvas](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/819456/assignments/2871967).
What was appealing about projects? What made the search difficult? What project(s)
are you planning to contribute to, and why?
