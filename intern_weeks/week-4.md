To give back to the community and to help keep up on code, try to identify an open
source opportunity that you can work on. Start by reading
[8 simple steps for contributing to open source](http://www.sitepoint.com/8-simple-steps-for-contributing-to-open-source/)
Then try to find a project to work on, which can be difficult, here are some ways to get

1. [Code Triage](http://www.codetriage.com/) and [Open Hatch](https://openhatch.org) are great tools to help search for projects
2. Find a suitable bug or request on [Github Issues](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2)
3. If you ever wished "Geee... I wish gem X did Z", that may be a good oppurtunity to communiciate with the author about adding the feature.
4. Whenever you experience a plain ol' bug in a gem, fix it and submit a pull request.

If you find a project that would allow for multiple contributors or pairing, share!
