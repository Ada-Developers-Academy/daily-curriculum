# Week 6 - Intro to Rails

Week 6 we introduce students to the Ruby on Rails framework, which will be the focus of much of their work for the remainder of the course. Working in pairs, students build [a basic Rails application](ada_cooks.md). The focus is on learning how Rails and its implementation of MVC differ from Sinatra, how to work with ActiveRecord models and relationships, and begin to develop very basic proficiency with Rails.

## Goals
+ solidify understanding of web response cycle
+ introduce Rails
+ improve workflow
+ practice pair programming skills
