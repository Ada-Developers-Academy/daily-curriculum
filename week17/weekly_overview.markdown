# Week 17

In Week 17 we will continue a 2 week long unit on Refactoring and Service Oriented Architecture. Students will refactor a previous project, and build a Shipping service for their Congo projects. The emphasis will be on instilling good code craftsmanship and citizenship, exploring service APIs, and continuing to develop competency with testing.

As in Week 15, this week lectures may be Ã  la carte, some potential topics to talk about as a class or in smaller groups:


## Goals
- Successful pair & group programming experience
- Identify recent knowledge gains through refactoring older code
- learn how to read other people's code
- Build an API
