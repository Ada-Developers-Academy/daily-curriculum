# Week 15

In Week 15 we will be continuing a 2 week long pairing project in which students will build a community garden planning application. The emphasis will be on building strong pair programming skills, revisiting the lessons of the previous 2 projects, and continuing to develop competency with testing.

This week lectures may be Ã  la carte, some potential topics to talk about as a class or in smaller groups:

- MVC (what goes where & why)
- Mocks & Stubs in Testing
- Webmock[https://github.com/bblimke/webmock] [tutorial](http://marnen.github.io/webmock-presentation/webmock.html#(1))
- [Heroku Resque AutoScaler](https://github.com/G5/heroku_resque_autoscaler)
- Advanced Views
- Testing Views (capybara)
- Creating a Gem

## Goals
- Successful pair programming experience
- Develop personal project management skills

    + Weather

    + Resque
    + ActionMailer
    + Scheduler
