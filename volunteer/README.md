# Volunteer Information
Ada is a community-supported organization, and we rely on the talents of professional software developers for teaching assistantship, guest lectures, and curriculum oversight.

## How to get involved
1. Complete the Volunteer Information Survey: http://goo.gl/forms/NpoVLLMQt2
2. Return a signed copy of the [Volunteer Code of Conduct](volunteer-handbook.pdf) to contact@adadevelopersacademy.org

You should hear back from Ada staff shortly afterwards to schedule a no-obligation visit to the classroom so you can check out our program up-close!
