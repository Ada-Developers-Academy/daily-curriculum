# Preparing for Interviews

In the next couple of weeks, you'll have the opportunity to sit down with the hiring managers and team leads of the companies hosting interns. To make sure that these short interviews are successful for you and them, please prepare the following:

- Your updated resume (in Markdown)
- Link to your favorite application (GitHub URL and Heroku URL)
- A link to a code sample (a model from one of your projects that you're particularly proud of, or another assignment)

Please turn them in on Canvas no later than Friday, 3/21. We will share these with the companies ahead of time, so they're ready to ask you specific questions about your expertise and background.
