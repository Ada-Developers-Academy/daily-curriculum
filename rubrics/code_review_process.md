#Code Review Process

Steps for projects for students and reviewer:

|  who           | does what
|----------------|--------------------------------
| Instructor     | introduces a new project
| Student        | makes a new GitHub repo with their solution, with a README that includes a link to the project description followed by the blank rubric inline
| Instructor     | assigns a code reviewer (gives student the code reviewer's GitHub handle)
| Student        | gives access to code reviewer
| Instructor     | emails code reviewers to let them know their is code to review
| Code Reviewer  | forks a branch called "codereview"
| Code Reviewer  | reads project description and rubric and then reviews the code
| Code Reviewer  | leave comments and code changes in the code
| Code Reviewer  | completes rubric with leveling and overall comments/suggestions
| Code Reviewer  | creates a pull request
| Student        | gets a notification of the PR
| Student/Code Reviewer |  converse on PR
| Student        | DOES NOT merge; so that their code is preserved separate from the Code Reviewer
