### PROJECT LEARNING GOALS

| Rating | Content           | Description
|--------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
|        | Variables                | Variables names are logical, clear, and in snake case. Variables are not needlessly assigned or reassigned ([variable examples](#variables)).
|        | Loops                    | While loops control the flow of the code, keeping the user on track, and continuing the program until an appropriate end point.
|        | Data Types               | Hashes, arrays, strings, symbols, numbers, and booleans used appropriately. ([data type examples](#data-types))
|        | Conditionals & Operators | Logical and mathematical operators guide program flow efficiently and properly deal with edge cases ([operator/conditional examples](#conditional--operators)).

### Examples or somesuch

#### Variables
```ruby
# Good:
post_height = 7.0
user_name = gets.chomp

# Bad:
p = 7
ph = '7.0'
postHeight = 77
```

#### Conditionals & Operators
```ruby
x = 2

# Good:
if x < 2
  result = "x is less than 2"
elsif x > 2
  result = "x is greater than 2"
else
  result = "x is exactly 2"
end

puts result

# Bad:
if x < 2
  result = "x is less than 2"
elsif x > 2
  result = "x is greater than 2"
end

puts result

```

#### Data Types
```ruby
# Good:
name = "Bobbina"
honorific = "Ms. #{name}"

# Bad:
num = '2'
total = 1 + num.to_i
```


### CODE QUALITY

| Rating | Skill          | Description
|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
|        | Correctness    | Code runs without errors or bugs. Edge cases are tested for and handled appropriately. Unit tests are written for appropriate testing of code correctness.
|        | Readability    | Formatting is consistent. Naming conventions are followed. Spacing vs tabs is consistent, code is concise and methods do not span longer than one screen. Each group of statements creates a complete thought and those thoughts are separated by blank lines. If one function calls another, they should be vertically close, and the caller should be above the callee, if at all possible. Variable and method names are meaningful. Well named constants are used for values that are used throughout a program.
|        | Structure      | Methods performs one, and only one, function. Blocks of code that are run multiple times
are not cut-and-pasted, but instead are written as loops and functions. Variables are not duplicated unecessarily.
|        | Efficiency     |
|        | Comments       | Comments accurately describe code logic and are placed before or on the line they describe. Comment are either: information that canâ€™t be expressed in code, intent comments, or summary comments.
