### PROJECT LEARNING GOALS

| Rating | Concept    | Description
|--------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
|        |Variables   | Variables names are logical, clear, and in snake case (Good: "post_height", Bad: 'ph, p, postHeight'). Variables are not needlessly assigned or reassigned (Good: "input = 2; input += 2" Bad: "input = 2; num = input; input = num + 2"). |
|        | Functions  | Functions are designed for a single purpose, do not have both a result and side-effects, and are logically named in snake case. |
|        | Classes    | Classes represent a single idea, and contain all of the functionality and information associated with that idea. |
|        | Hashes     | Hashes are used, and their particular attributes (having key value pairs, mapping, etc) are used well, with keys having logical, clear names written in snake case. |
|        | Arrays     | Code demonstrates correctly iterating over arrays, and accessing array elements by index. |
|        | Strings    | Strings are used and manipulated (compared, concatenated) correctly to prevent data loss and incorrect output. |
|        | Operators  | Logical and mathematical operators guide program flow efficiently and properly deal with edge cases (Bad(what if x is 2?): if x < 2; return x; elsif x > 2; return nil; end Good: if x < 2; return x; if x > 2; return nil; else; return 2; end). |
