## Expectations

Ada is difficult. Very very difficult.

Programming is difficult. Logic can be difficult, but abstract ideas are more difficult.
That is where programming will get you, is the abstract ideas. And the magic.

We'll talk about magic a bunch. Magic is when the programming language executes some code
but so much happens internally that there is a disconnect between the result and your current
knowledge.

Two of my favorite analogies for programming are:

**Spoken language**: Learning programming is like learning a spoken language, except, in programming,
terms even grammar and foundational concepts constantly change. What if french suddenly used
clicks and all verb conjugation changed?

**Music**: Learning music is a never ending endeavor. Different instruments create many different
noises. Learning like instruments will help learn others, for example the Violin and Cello, but that
doesn't have to do much with drums. Additionally, even after learning how to read music and being
instructed on how to play the violin, that hardly makes you a master, in fact you've just begun.


- It's easy to believe you're not good because it doesn't make sense. The thing is is that it
doesn't make sense. The concepts are very abstract.
- Software is a **VERY** large field, you can only learn so much in six months, and that is all that is
expected of you. But having one field of knowledge greatly improves your ability to expand.
- Knowing that you can't know everything is important. You will end up knowing about 5% of what you want to know, but that's ok. No one knows everything.

Learning
--------

### You are not here to learn how to make websites, you are here to learn how to teach your self technology ideas, concepts, and practices.
**Learning is the most important part of Software**

We are all here to learn, including myself and the TA's.


As you know technology changes very quickly, getting really good a specific technology is near
useless. But, learning how to learn new technologies is the most powerful tool you can have.

People who graduated CS programs 20 years ago, are not doing the same thing they did at the time, they
also didn't go to retraining, they self taught their current technologies.

What does it take to accomplish this?

1. Practice. And lots of it.
2. Asking questions.
3. Failing. Fail fast, fail often.
4. Being comfortable with all of the above

Feeling comfortable about failing can be particularly difficult in a setting like Ada, it may seem there
are very high expectations, but I promise if you can demonstrate comfort with failing you will
succeed (unless you're lazy).

Because comfort is so important, culture really matters. What **NOT** do to:

- "Well Actually's". Posted by [Miguel de Icaza](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/Feb-17.html):

> Countless times as engineers you will find yourself interrupting someone telling a story, an anecdote or a joke to correct a false assumption, provide an extra fact that the narrator overlooked, give a bigger perspective on the problem or point out that the joke premise is actually flawed.
>
> You can identify this behavior because the person interrupting usually starts with the phrase "Well, actually...".
>
> As a kid, I thought this was my strength. I knew a little bit more than my sister. So whenever she would say something, I would quickly interject something like "Well, actually, the origin of the word Shih Tzu means Lion Dog and has nothing to do with the dog's digestive patterns".
>
> Yes, I was really fun to hang out with.

- Unwelcome Competition. [Competition, a Feminist Taboo](http://www.feministpress.org/):

> Unwelcome competition satisfies neither the inventor of the competition nor it's object...
> If ever cooperation should be substituted for competition, it should be in such a
> situation. Sadly, lack of self-confidence, which engenders senseless competition,
> also render collaboration difficult.

- [Feighning suprise](https://www.hackerschool.com/manual)

> What?! I can't believe you don't know what the stack is!"

- Answering questions not directed at you. Questions are often asked for clarification or when something is clicking, part of that process is bouncing those ideas off of someone.
If you interject and give a quick technical answer, usually that is not what they were looking for, you've probably broken their thought process, and worse, they may now feel as if their
chance to ask has passed since it was answered by you.


[Hacker School has a fantastic manual](https://www.hackerschool.com/manual). Read it for more of how to be a great classmate.

Commitment
----------

We expect you to be commited, vey commited:

- Class is 9 - 5 monday through friday. We will occasionally have scheduled breaks for holidays
and rest. Other than that you are expected to be in class and on time.
- And homework.

Outcome
-------

So what will you get after all of this difficult work?

- You will be a software developer.
- An engineer, programmer, whatever you want to call it.
- You will be valueable to many companies
- But, you will not know everything, and that's ok.
- You won't be high on the ladder.
- But you will be on the ladder.
- You have to continue to work hard to climb that ladder
