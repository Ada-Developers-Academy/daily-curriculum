Let's Make More!
================

Let's make a planetary system! 

+ Create a Planet class
+ Create a SolarSystem class that has an attribute "planets" that has 0-??? Planets
+ make a new directory inside the *examples/week2/solar_systems/* directory named for your solar system, and put all your work in that folder
+ Get creative! Give new Planets random names, diameters, mass, moons.. whatever!
+ When you're done, help someone else
