Homework
========
+ Read Chapter 13 of Learning To Program
  + We'll be working with the Baby Dragon class on Tuesday, and I've already typed it up in the *daily-curriculum/examples* directory so you don't have to. Read through the code and make sure you understand how it works. **Feel free to copy the file to a working directory and customize it to your heart's content!**
+ Write down the 3 stand up questions
+ Homework repo (details TBA)
