### Open Source Contributions

To give back to the community and to help keep up on code, try to identify an open
source opportunity that you can work on. Start by reading
[8 simple steps for contributing to open source](http://www.sitepoint.com/8-simple-steps-for-contributing-to-open-source/)
Then try to find a project to work on, which can be difficult, here are some ways to get

1. [Code Triage](http://www.codetriage.com/) and [Open Hatch](https://openhatch.org) are great tools to help search for projects
2. Find a suitable bug or request on [Github Issues](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2)
3. If you ever wished "Geee... I wish gem X did Z", that may be a good oppurtunity to communiciate with the author about adding the feature.
4. Whenever you experience a plain ol' bug in a gem, fix it and submit a pull request.

If you find a project that would allow for multiple contributors or pairing, share!
