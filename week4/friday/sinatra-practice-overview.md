## Homework

#### Sinatra Practice

The purpose of the Sinatra Practice homework is to reiterate and practice the basics of a Sinatra application. The end result should be a single page website hosted on Heroku. The application will also be used as a "blank canvas" to learn and experiment with HTML and CSS in the next week.

#### After this lesson you will be able to:

1. Create a basic Sinatra application
2. Define url's that the application will accept (routes)
3. Create an individual html/erb file for our route
4. Add basic HTML/CSS to the viewable page
5. Start the application on a local server
6. View the application in a web browser
7. Use Heroku to deploy and host the application for the world to see
