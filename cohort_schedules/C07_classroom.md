# Ada Developers Academy Cohort 7 Syllabus

## Overview

Ada Developers Academy teaches full-stack web development, allowing students to choose what specialty of software development they want to pursue in their post-Ada careers. We cover HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and computer science fundamentals. Our [complete curriculum](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/) is online and open-source.

We focus on teaching skills that are readily transferrable from one technology stack to another, making Ada students adaptable and flexible candidates for all types of developer positions.
