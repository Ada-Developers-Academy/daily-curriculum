A second major theme for the week is the use of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to quickly build responsive websites. Basic validations for model classes are introduced, and the week's project has requirements for using them on each model.

### Learning Goals
- Understand how models can be checked for validity, and how validation requirements can be defined

## Week 11
Week 11 brings the first group, multi-week project for students. This is a major expansion of the project development process that we've used in the classroom until now. In order to emphasize the Agile methodology discussed in previous weeks teams select task managers and stand up leads, have stand up meetings with their project manager (instructor) each day, track all progress in Trello with user stories, and whiteboard site flows and entity relationships. Projects are demoed to project managers at the end of the week.

In addition to all of this, students are learning how to perform user authentication in Rails using session data and controller filters. Advanced validations for model classes are also discussed, and the bEtsy project provides several opportunities for using custom validations.

### Learning Goals
- Long-term project development with the Agile methodology
- Different team member roles (task manager, stand up leader, project manager)
- Password-based user authentication in Rails
- Authorization of specific actions/routes in Rails
- Building custom validations for advanced model designs

## Week 12
Week 12 finishes up the first team project for students. Within each team a different set of students take on the Task Manager and Stand Up Leader roles, but teams retain their previous Project Manager (instructor). Emphasis this week is on getting to a "feature complete" state; improving code quality through testing and code coverage; and presenting a project demo to colleagues and stakeholders.

Because we're continuing with the bEtsy project from Week 11, there is not much new lecture material. Crystal is presenting another CS Fundamentals lecture on the mergesort algorithm, and Kari will cover the use of GitHub Issues for contributing to open source projects by reporting bugs or feature requests.

### Learning Goals
- Long-term project development with the Agile methodology
- Different team member roles (task manager, stand up leader, project manager)
- Collaborating on other people's/teams' projects using GitHub Issues

## Week 13
Week 13 only has one day of class time, on Monday. We are taking the opportunity provided by this short week to run our own Ada Hackathon! Students present their project ideas (all card games in standard Ruby) and classmates sign up to be part of their team along with at least one TA or instructor.

### Learning Goals
- Hackathons are fun and social experiences!
- Have a great winter break!

### Resources

## Week 14
Week 14 is our introduction to working with Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Web APIs allow for the integration of our website with various services provided by other organizations. These services will supercharge our Rails apps and provide the final piece of our back-end programming curriculum.

Our project for Week 14 is another two-week team effort, further emphasizing the collaboration, agile methodology, and team management skills. For this project, teams build a site which allows users to sign-up with a social media account, and to then track other social media users using one integrated activity feed.

### Learning Goals
- JSON and XML data formats for computer-computer interaction
- OAuth and the standard web-based login flow
- Using the OmniAuth gem to integrate OAuth strategies for popular social networks
- APIs - What they are and how to use them
