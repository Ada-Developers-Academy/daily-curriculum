## Week 4

In Week 4 we introduce introduce Test-Driven Development (TDD) and basic networking concepts. We will spend 2 days exploring TDD and the rspec toolset through building our own testing projects and tests. We then pivot into an introduction of the "plumbing" of the Internet and how clients such as web browsers communicate with servers.

## Week 9

In week 9 we will be focusing on comprehension of the rails request cycle. Students will be creating a simple rails app to store and rank media by type.

### Learning Goals

- Identify the role of HTTP request
- Advanced understanding of the role, scope, and syntax or routes.rb
- Understanding of rails controller
    - Native controller method (params, session, render, redirect_to, etc...)
    - Scope with inter-controller methods and instance variables
- Understanding of rails views,
    - Availability of controller methods and instance variables
    - View Helpers
- __Learn to identify and describe the current state and availabilty of different methods and variables at any given point in the request cycle.__

__Weekend Homework__

Create your own app

OR

Create a single serving (no users) version of Twitter. The app should have:

- Tweet model
    - body (must be present, max 140 characters long)
    - author
- TweetsController
    - An `index` action which shows all of the tweets
    - A `show` action to view a specific tweet
    - A `new` action (optional, you can put the form on `index`)
    - A `create` action where tweets are created

__optional__

- tweet_spec.rb
    - Testing validations of body (presence and length)
    - Testing any addition methods you add
- tweets_controller_spec.rb
    - Test each controller action
    - No need to test private actions

__Extra Credit__

Implement Users using a TDD approach.

## Week 10

## Week 11

Week 11 will be a break from Rails to focus on JavaScript and jQuery. We'll focus first on learning core JavaScript language concepts, and then how to use JavaScript and jQuery to program web pages in the browser. Students will create a simple to do list app to add to do list items dynamically to a web page. By the end of the week, students will be able to use JavaScript and jQuery to interact with and modify web pages, and use JavaScript variables, types, arrays, functions, objects, and jQuery methods.

### Learning Goals

- Understanding of core JavaScript concepts and features:
    - variables
    - types
    - arrays
    - functions
    - scope
    - objects
- Understanding of the DOM and how the browser loads and represents web pages.
- Using JavaScript and jQuery to modify a web page:
    - with the JavaScript document object and associated methods
    - with jQuery's $ function and associated methods
- Understanding event handlers to write code that responds to user interaction.

__Weekend Homework__

Look at the jQuery ajax (http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) API and
think about how you might send a list of to do items to store on
the server with Rails. In this week's projects, the to do items
are not saved; they go away each time you reload the page. By sending
the items to the server you can save them for use in a subsequent session.

OR

Take a look at JavaScript's JSON object (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JSON),
and the Local Storage API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Storage).
Add code to your to do list manager to save items in localStorage.

## Week 12

In week 12 work on [SeeMore project](../topic_resources/see-more.md), in which the students will create a RESTful web API from a public or private data source, and learn to work within a larger Agile team.

### Learning Goals
- Identify when to use an external web API
- Create a web API
- Build data in JSON or XML format
- Consume data in JSON or XML format
- HTTP from Ruby ([HTTParty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty))
- local User creation via OAuth service
- push to authorized services via APIs
- increasing comfort with API interactions
- increasing professional comportment and team project skills
- focus on project "polish" and customer deliverables
