## Week 5
In week 5 we will be learning the basics of HTML & CSS. By the end of the week we will style a single page website using the common HTML & CSS practices and deploy it to [Heroku](http://heroku.com). 

Our learning will focus on the usage of basic HTML tags and their potential attributes. We will learn about CSS selectors, cascading rules, and common techniques for creating important web page elements.

#### Update

Wednesday has changed a bit. Instead of working on HTML frameworks, we are now going to work through implementing a blog function within our application.

The homework will now be delayed until Monday due to the added work for the week.
