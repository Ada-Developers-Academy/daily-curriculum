In the Personal Website project, we will be using the [Sinatra Application](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/daily-curriculum/blob/master/week4/friday/sinatra-practice-overview.md) you built over the weekend. We will be adding HTML content and styling with CSS to the [index.erb](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/daily-curriculum/blob/master/week4/friday/sinatra_practice/views/index.erb) page. The goal is to have a single page website to promote yourself and/or to have fun.

1. Mock-up a website layout using common tools
2. Implement an HTML structure based on a mock-up using up-to-date practices.
3. Learn and practice the implementation of the most common HTML Tags
4. Link to separate CSS files.
5. Style a webpage using basic CSS techniques
