# Month 1 Assessment
Over this weekend we will be assigning a Month 1 Assessment which will cover all topics from our curriculum for weeks 1 through 4. Each student will receive a grade for this assessment based on a sum of scores for each topic area covered.

We will be using the results of this assessment to determine our schedule for the upcoming month, figure out tutoring assignments, and design any performance improvement plans if necessary. We will also provide specific feedback to each student based on these results including a discussion of where your progress falls in relation to our schedule for each topic area.

## Skill Assessment Topics
### Ruby Fundamentals
#### Variables and Substitution
Questions from this section will cover the creation, naming, and use of local variables. The use of variables will focus on following the "substitution process" for determining the value of a particular variable.

#### Mathematical Equations
In this section questions will all focus upon the use of mathematical operators to build equations. Equations may include variables in addition to numbers, and will require an understanding of the "order of operations" for mathematics:
- P (parentheses)
- E (exponentiation -- not used in Ruby)
- M (multiplication)
- D (division, same order as multiplication)
- A (addition)
- S (subtraction, same order as addition)

When multiple operations are on the same order (such as addition and subtraction) then all of those operations are done at the same time, from left to right.

#### Basic Methods
Questions in this section will cover the use of methods, both those provided by Ruby and ones that we create ourselves. Creating new methods, accepting parameters in methods, passing parameters in methods, and using default parameters will also be covered here.

#### Basic Datatypes
This section will have questions that cover core Ruby data types including:
- Numbers
- Strings
- Booleans
- Symbols
- Arrays
- Hashes
- Nil

Questions will also cover the use of simple methods on these data types (e.g. `uppercase` for strings and `include?` for arrays).

#### Conditionals and Comparisons
Questions in this section will cover the use of conditional statements and loops including `if` and `while`; the use of comparison operators such as `==` and `>=`; and the use of logical operators such as `&&` and `||` to combine comparisons into larger conditionals. 

#### Advanced Variables
Questions in this section will cover these types of variables:
- Constants
- Globals

General knowledge of scope and recommended usage are the only aspects of these that will be covered.

#### Iterators and Enumerables
Questions in this section will deal with the use of iterators such as `each` and `times` to repeat code or loop over a data type that contains multiple elements (e.g. an array). Enumerable methods, such as `map` and `find` will also be covered, including their use on different enumerable data types (such as arrays and hashes).

### Object Orientation
#### Basic Classes
This section will contain questions about the creation and use of classes in Ruby. Specific topics covered include
- Defining classes that can be initialized with parameters.
- Creating new instances of a class.
- Defining instance methods on a class.
- The difference between local and instance variables, and the scopes for both types of variable.
- Providing access to instance variables using attribute reader/writer/accessor lines.
- Writing classes that use instances of other classes and call instance methods defined on those classes.

#### Advanced Classes
This section covers more advanced usage of classes including inheritance, class methods and variables, and modules. Key points within this section are the use of inheritance to make methods from parent classes accessible to child classes, overwriting parent class methods inside of child classes, and using super to call parent class methods from within child classes.

### Debugging Code
Questions in this section will cover the use of IRB, Ruby, and Pry to debug your code interactively.

### Git and Github
Questions in this section will cover using Git to save your work, as well as all versions of that work, and using both Git and Github to share your work with other members of your team. Questions about the project creation and submission (cloning, forking, and pull requests) will not be covered.

### Workflow
This section will contain questions about general programming workflow. Specifically there will be questions about creating files and folders, using the terminal to run commands and start Ruby/IRB/Git/Atom, and using the terminal to navigate within your project files and folders.
