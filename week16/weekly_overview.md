# Week 16

In Week 16 we will be begin a 2 week long unit on Refactoring and Service Oriented Architecture. Students will refactor a previous project, and build a Shipping service for their Congo projects. The emphasis will be on instilling good code craftsmanship and citizenship, exploring service APIs, and continuing to develop competency with testing.

As in Week 15, this week lectures may be Ã  la carte, some potential topics to talk about as a class or in smaller groups:

- MVC (what goes where & why)
- Mocks & Stubs in Testing
- Webmock[https://github.com/bblimke/webmock] [tutorial](http://marnen.github.io/webmock-presentation/webmock.html#(1))
- [Heroku Resque AutoScaler](https://github.com/G5/heroku_resque_autoscaler)
- Advanced Views
- Testing Views (capybara)
- Creating a Gem

Additionally, there will be an optional demo of building an app start to finish, in 1 or 2 sections (depending on interest.)

## Goals
- Successful pair & group programming experience
- Identify recent knowledge gains through refactoring older code
- learn how to read other people's code
- Build an API
