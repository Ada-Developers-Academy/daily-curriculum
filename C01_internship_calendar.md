### Open Source Contributions

To give back to the community and to help keep up on code, try to identify an open
source opportunity that you can work on. Start by reading
[8 simple steps for contributing to open source](http://www.sitepoint.com/8-simple-steps-for-contributing-to-open-source/)
Then try to find a project to work on, which can be difficult, here are some ways to get

1. [Code Triage](http://www.codetriage.com/) and [Open Hatch](https://openhatch.org) are great tools to help search for projects
2. Find a suitable bug or request on [Github Issues](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2)
3. If you ever wished "Geee... I wish gem X did Z", that may be a good oppurtunity to communiciate with the author about adding the feature.
4. Whenever you experience a plain ol' bug in a gem, fix it and submit a pull request.

If you find a project that would allow for multiple contributors or pairing, share!


## Week 2 of Internships

| Time       | Topic |
|:----------:|:------------------------------:|
|1:00 - 4:00 | One on One Review of Internship*|

|2:00 - 4:00 | Language swap / OS / Personal Project time |
|4:00 - 5:00 | Week 1 Retrospective          |

This week will will spend most of our time doing two things:

1. Taking time to expand our knowledge through focused work, we will often have time on Thursdays for this kind of thing, ongoing ideas are totally acceptable here:
    - Meet with other who are learning that same new language as you
        - Code review any open source code from your company (keep your NDA in mind)
        - Code review personal projects
        - Start a small project together, this could be a Hello World app or something to work on over the course of your entire internship
    - Identify and contribute to an open source project
    - Begin or continue a personal project
2. Meeting with an instructor to review your internship experience. Plan to talk about:
    - Issues that you see arising
    - Your understanding of your role as a developer
    - The technical problems you face
    - Your contributions so far

**One on ones will be during the other activities*

**REMINDER** Headcount for luncheon.

    - Two groups of three should tackle the technical submissions together.
2. Taking time to expand our knowledge through focused work, we will often have time on Thursdays for this kind of thing, ongoing ideas are totally acceptable here:
    - Meet with other who are learning that same new language as you

*As of 6/18 we have completed 598 reviews, I estimate that we will need to complete
about 1,000 to have full coverage (~5 reviews/submission) for round 1. If everyone completes 33
additional reviews we will be done!

After completing reviews (or if you've completed > 100 already) then feel free to work
on anything you want. Some students have asked for the opportunity to pair and get
help on problems they are having, this kind of in-class free time is *always* a
good time for this kind of work. Alternately you can work on the project listed below.

that you are currently learning. Include:

|:----------:|:--------------------------------:|
|1:00 - 4:30 | Open Source Project |
|4:30 - 5:00 | Retro               |

### Interviews
Bookis and Elise are going to be in cohort 2 interviews until 3:30. We'll have interviewees
coming into the classroom, so feel free to chat - but don't divulge any secrets! ;)
Otherwise, please get started on the Open Source Project:

### Open Source Project
Over the next 6 weeks, you'll be spending the majority of your Ada class time
contributing to an open source project of your choice. This project is meant to give
you some dedicated time to work on and give back to the OSS community (without OSS,
  we wouldn't have been able to teach Ruby in class)!

#### Project Deliverables
- Depending on the size/scope of the contribution, submit a minimum of one pull request
to an OSS project or library no later than 8/27.
- Complete 3 blog posts about the project: one due this week (selecting/starting OSS project),
one due 8/6 (check in on progress), and one due at the completion of the project on 8/27
(retrospective).
- Prepare a 5 minute talk about the project/library and your contribution
to present during Cohort 2's first week of class (9/2-9/5).

#### Choosing a Project
Read [8 simple steps for contributing to open source](http://www.sitepoint.com/8-simple-steps-for-contributing-to-open-source/)
and [How to contribute to an open source project](http://myronmars.to/n/dev-blog/2011/09/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project).
Then, try to find at least one project that's interesting and needs help. (At least
one because you may want to have a couple of options if one goes nowhere). If you
find a project that would allow for multiple contributors or pairing, share! If you've
already been contributing to an open source project and would like to continue, you are welcome
to do so.

Check out the below tools to get started:

1. [Code Triage](http://www.codetriage.com/) and [Open Hatch](https://openhatch.org) are great tools to help search for projects.
2. Find a suitable bug or request on [Github Issues](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2)
3. If you ever wished "Geee... I wish gem X did Z", that may be a good opportunity to
communicate with the author about adding the feature. Occasionally, libraries will have
contribution protocols in the project README.
4. Experienced a plain ol' bug in a gem? Fix it and submit a pull request.
5. Advice from the internet:
  [RubyGems Adoption Center](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rubygems-org/niS5ZO9DNgk/SHUzS-8Qx68J)
  [RailsBridge's BridgeTroll project](https://github.com/railsbridge/bridge_troll/issues)
  Django: [Andrew from Foundry](https://twitter.com/marginoferror) has offered to help anyone interested in contribution.
  KDE and GNOME projects: [Ian](https://twitter.com/redbluemagenta) can help get you started.
  [RSpec](https://t.co/yszq0TvA8G)

#### Due Friday
Write about your experience searching for an OSS project and submit [URL to Canvas](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/819456/assignments/2871967).
What was appealing about projects? What made the search difficult? What project(s)
are you planning to contribute to, and why?
