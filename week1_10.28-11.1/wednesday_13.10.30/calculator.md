There's a bug in this code! Can you find it?

Next Steps
----------
1. Instead of printing the result, print out the formula ("2+2=4")
2. Try adding ability to 
     + divide
     + multiply
     + find the exponent (such as 2 to the fourth or 2^4 or 2*2*2*2)
     + find the square root of a single number
3. Rather than typing in the name of the mathematical function, could we accept the symbol?
4. If the user enters "nil" (just hits enter) instead of a number, what happens? Assuming they meant "0" instead, can our code adjust?
5. What happens if the user enters a String instead of a Number? Can we print an error message if they do that?
6. Quit early if the action is not within our parameters.
