## Audrey Carlsen
Audrey is a native Seattlite and current student at Ada Developers Academy. She came to programming after being a student at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a stint at NPR headquarters. In addition to creating the radio show “This Carleton Life” as an undergrad at Carleton College, she has also spent time reporting for an NPR member station in the Aleutian Islands. Audrey hopes to see her programming career diversify her skill set as well as merge her past and current passions. She thoroughly enjoys her synesthesia and would pick time manipulation as her superpower. Although flying would also be nice.
