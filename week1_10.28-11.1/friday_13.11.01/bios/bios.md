## Davida Marion
Davida Marion comes to the first cohort of Ada Developers Academy as a specialist in library sciences and data integrity.  Her professional experiences range from freelance writing, content management, copy editing, library archiving, and ice-cream-making wizardry.  

Davida's experiences in navigating her way through labyrinthine library stacks inspired her to consider problems of information management.  She also enjoys the detail-oriented nature of programming, and how to manipulate minute parameters and restrictions to engineer ideas and solve complex problems.  She chases the thrill of finding the optimal solution to a given problem and seeing it through to the end. 

In her free time, Davida climbs, writes, plays ultimate frisbee and fantasy football, and makes the best meatballs in Seattle.

## Elizabeth Uselton

Elizabeth Uselton is a banana slug from UC Santa Cruz where she earned a BA in Theater Arts. As a mollusc, she has greatly enjoyed rainy Seattle since 2008. She enjoys Star Wars, using theatrical makeup to make people look gruesome and explaining brachiosaur cardiopulmonary systems. Computer Science has always been a peripheral part of her life as she several relatives in the field, including a grandmother with an MS in CS. However, Elizabeth’s interest in code comes from a more right-brained place. “I never wanted to choose a career because I didn’t want to close other doors and limit my options. Software development seemed like the perfect way to creatively reconcile my diverse interests.”

## Hsing-Hui Hsu
Hsing-Hui Hsu is a student at Ada Academy and an experienced linguist in Seattle WA. 

Determined to experience life from as many perspectives as possible, she has spent time learning multiple languages, including French, Chinese, and Dutch, since the same concept can feel different being expressed in different languages. She also has a Bachelor's in music performance, and is a trained clarinetist and pianist. She has also worked as a math and ESL instructor.

Hsing-Hui's background in spoken languages, as well as her general interest in math and logic has drawn her towards programming. Computer languages break everything down to the smallest expressions, and then build them back up -- similar to her teaching style, where she had to take difficult concepts and break them apart to make them understandable to non-native English speakers.

When she's not excitedly teaching herself something new, Hsing-Hui is a fantastic ultimate frisbee player and  biker.
