Anne Kimsey is excellent at resisting writing self-descriptions. She prefers reading books about linguistics in French (a holdover from the BA she has in those subjects), making maps with GIS, backpacking, running, biking, traveling to strange and exotic locations like Canada and petting other people's pets. These days though, most of her time is spent working on her screen glow tan and tapping out Ruby code, a path she stumbled on by accident when a student of hers insisted that she "teach him how to computer." As it turns out, she enjoyed learning with a Raspberry Pi and Python much more than the student did. She moved to Seattle to pursue tech not long after this discovery, and has been excitedly "computer-ing" ever since.

## Asha Golveo

Asha Golveo is an aspiring software developer from Sacramento, CA. She has a BS in Business Administration with a concentration in Accountancy. Before moving to Seattle in the summer of 2013, she worked as an Assistant Project Manager for a lighting manufacturing company. She is passionate about technology and the positive effects it can have in our daily lives. Asha became interested in programming after following numerous tech blogs and deciding she no longer wanted to just read about technology, but learn more about computer science and develop her own applications. After using a book to teach herself Python, she immediately fell in love with programming. She is fascinated by the power to build ideas that come to mind and the countless ways to solve one problem. In Asha’s spare time, you can find her reading, running, playing the violin, and finding new things to learn.

## Hsing-Hui Hsu

Hsing-Hui Hsu is a student at Ada Academy and an experienced linguist in Seattle WA. 

Determined to experience life from as many perspectives as possible, she has spent time learning multiple languages, including French, Chinese, and Dutch, since the same concept can feel different being expressed in different languages. She also has a Bachelor's in music performance, and is a trained clarinetist and pianist. She has also worked as a math and ESL instructor.

Hsing-Hui's background in spoken languages, as well as her general interest in math and logic has drawn her towards programming. Computer languages break everything down to the smallest expressions, and then build them back up -- similar to her teaching style, where she had to take difficult concepts and break them apart to make them understandable to non-native English speakers.

When she's not excitedly teaching herself something new, Hsing-Hui is a fantastic ultimate frisbee player and  biker.
