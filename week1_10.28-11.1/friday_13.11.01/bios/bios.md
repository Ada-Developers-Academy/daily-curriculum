## Anne Kimsey
Anne Kimsey is a proto-developer and outdoor enthusiast in Seattle, WA. Anne has a degree in linguistics from Evergreen State College. She loves the idea of language as way to distill all possibilities of human thought, but thinks she may have more luck demanding such specificity of computers. Anne has a varied background in teaching English and French, but decided to be a computer programmer after teaching a Burmese refugee Python on a Raspberry Pi. In her free time you can find Anne hiking… if you can keep up! When she’s not camping and or hiking she spends time reading an old fashioned paper book. She enjoys canine companionship.
