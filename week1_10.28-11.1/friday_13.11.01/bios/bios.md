## Davida Marion
Davida Marion comes to the first cohort of Ada Developers Academy as a specialist in library sciences and data integrity.  Her professional experiences range from freelance writing, content management, copy editing, library archiving, and ice-cream-making wizardry.  

Davida's experiences in navigating her way through labyrinthine library stacks inspired her to consider problems of information management.  She also enjoys the detail-oriented nature of programming, and how to manipulate minute parameters and restrictions to engineer ideas and solve complex problems.  She chases the thrill of finding the optimal solution to a given problem and seeing it through to the end. 

In her free time, Davida climbs, writes, plays ultimate frisbee and fantasy football, and makes the best meatballs in Seattle.

However, Elizabeth’s interest in code comes from a more right-brained place. “I never wanted to choose a career because I didn’t want to close other doors and limit my options. Software development seemed like the perfect way to creatively reconcile my diverse interests.”
