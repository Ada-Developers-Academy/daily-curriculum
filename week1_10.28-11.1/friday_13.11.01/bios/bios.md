Liz was working as an administrative assistant in Portland, OR when it occurred to her that she would rather be making software than just testing it. She now studies at the Ada Developers Academy in Seattle and credits her mentor, Mel Quark, for helping to get her started. Originally from Idaho, Liz graduated two years ago from St. Louis University in Madrid, where she majored in communications and Spanish. She considers herself a passionate lesbian feminist and thinks a lot about the way that gender affects women's experiences. She wants to help other women pursue careers in technology and aims to one day found a company owned and run by women. Until then, she can usually be found reading or baking.(liz will edit this)
