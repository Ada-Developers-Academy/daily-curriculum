## Davida Marion
Davida Marion comes to the first cohort of Ada Developers Academy as a specialist in library sciences and data integrity.  Her professional experiences range from freelance writing, content management, copy editing, library archiving, and ice-cream-making wizardry.  

Davida's experiences in navigating her way through labyrinthine library stacks inspired her to consider problems of information management.  She also enjoys the detail-oriented nature of programming, and how to manipulate minute parameters and restrictions to engineer ideas and solve complex problems.  She chases the thrill of finding the optimal solution to a given problem and seeing it through to the end. 

In her free time, Davida climbs, writes, plays ultimate frisbee and fantasy football, and makes the best meatballs in Seattle.
