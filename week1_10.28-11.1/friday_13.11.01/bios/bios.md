## Sue White
Sue White is an ambitious up-and-coming programmer and a proud new Seattleite. Born and raised in rural Indiana, Sue studied biochemistry at the University of Iowa and spent several years doing academic research before she set her sights on web development. She currently speaks Python (and Russian!) but is already creating new programs in Ruby.   She still finds time for reading dense texts on finance and using her biochemistry background to concoct new vegan delicacies, but Sueâ€™s primary focus is on her new career as a programmer. She is excited to explore options and capitalize on her strengths.
