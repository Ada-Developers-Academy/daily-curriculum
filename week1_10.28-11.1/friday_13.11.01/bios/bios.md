Anne has a varied background in teaching English and French, but decided to be a computer programmer after teaching a Burmese refugee Python on a Raspberry Pi. In her free time you can find Anne hiking… if you can keep up! When she’s not camping and or hiking she spends time reading an old fashioned paper book. She enjoys canine companionship.

## Hsing-Hui Hsu
Hsing-Hui Hsu is a student at Ada Academy and an experienced linguist in Seattle WA. 

Determined to experience life from as many perspectives as possible, she has spent time learning multiple languages, including French, Chinese, and Dutch, since the same concept can feel different being expressed in different languages. She also has a Bachelor's in music performance, and is a trained clarinetist and pianist. She has also worked as a math and ESL instructor.

Hsing-Hui's background in spoken languages, as well as her general interest in math and logic has drawn her towards programming. Computer languages break everything down to the smallest expressions, and then build them back up -- similar to her teaching style, where she had to take difficult concepts and break them apart to make them understandable to non-native English speakers.

When she's not excitedly teaching herself something new, Hsing-Hui is a fantastic ultimate frisbee player and  biker.
