# Week 10

In week 10 we will be focusing on learning JavaScript. Students will
create an application that tracks the data of the users that visit their
site and then display that data on a dashboard. By the end of the week,
the students should have a basic working knowledge of the JavaScript
language and should be able to use it to manipulate the DOM as well as
draw within the canvas element.

## Goals
- Understand JavaScript's syntax, typing, and Object model
- Understand how to navigate and modify the DOM with or without jQuery
- Learn how canvas works, and the fundamentals of 2D line drawing
- Know how to identify some of JavaScript's idiosyncracies and how to
  track down bugs
