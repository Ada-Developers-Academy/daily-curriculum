# Dynamic Typing, Coercion, and Equality

This lesson will focus on JavaScript's Dynamic and weakly-typed type
system. Through that, we will learn the pitfalls of implicit coercions
and how to even begin to try to handle comparisons



### Static vs. Dynamic Typing
* Ruby has dynamic typing, so does JS
* Stating your type when declaring variables


### Strong vs. Weak Typing
* Are types coerced?
* Ruby is strongly typed, JS is weakly typed
* How does that affect you?


### 3 + true === 4
* Coercion
* "5" / "2" //=> 2.5 && 5/2 //=> 2.5
* "5"/"sandwich" //=> NaN


### [] + [] == "" && [] !== ""
* Arrays and Objects can be coerced into String as well.
* == vs ===
