A **feed** is an API that a web service uses to provide users with frequently updated content. A *feed aggregator*  is an application that acts as a central location for reviewing the content of feeds. It **injests** feeds and stores their content in its own datastore after [transforming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) it into a standard format.

## Goals
+ Learn how to work with OAuth
+ Gain experience in consuming with 3rd party APIs
+ Coordinate with a larger team
+ Work within the structure of 2 one-week Sprints
+ Learn how to work with Pivotal Tracker
+ Accumulate experience points in Rails
+ Accumulate experience points in rspec

## Guidelines

+ Groups of four will work with a Teacher acting as a Project Manager
+ Each group will assign a group leader to work with the Project Manager to organize the group work.
+ Each group will be responsible to deliver a final product to the Product Owner (Elise)
+ Use [pivotaltracker.com](http://pivotaltracker.com) as a project management service
+ Practice rspec to lead the development process of Models and Controllers
+ Build a logical user-flow that moves across multiple controllers and models
+ Use HTML/CSS to style your website.
