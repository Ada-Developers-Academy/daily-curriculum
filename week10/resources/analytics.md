# Analytics

In this project we will be building upon a Rails app by adding an
analytics dashboard to an existing project. This dashboard will be a
representation of the tabular data that is collected by the Rails app by
using Canvas and JS to draw a graph.

### Goals

By the end of the project students should be able to

- Read, write, debug some JavaScript
  - Scope
  - High-order functions
  - Type system
  - Constructors
  - Prototypes
  - Event listeners
  - Arrays
  - Debug Tools
- Understand incoming user information
- Progressively enhance data for easier consumption
- Draw on a canvas element using JavaScript


### Requirements

Your project must be "live" on the web for evaluation. We recommend you deploy it on [Heroku](http://Heroku.com).

Your `README` file on Github should contain a link to your live site.

Page with data must be presentable on:

IE8
Browser with JS turned off

Page with data must be drawn on:

IE10
Chrome
Firefox
iOS

For testing in IE, we recommend using [modern.ie](http://www.modern.ie/).
For testing in iOS, you will need to download XCode.
