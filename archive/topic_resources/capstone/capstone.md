# Capstone Project
The Capstone Project is the largest undertaking you'll experience in the Ada classroom. Not only is it a month long, but you will be your own product owner. It will be up to you to decide (with input from instructors, mentors, and TAs) what gets built when (and how).

### Teams
For the capstone project, you have the option to work individually or in a pair. If you do decide to work individually, you will have another individual with whom you will work with throughout the capstone as a sounding board and support system even though you will be working on different projects.

### Goals
- Demonstrate self-direction, time management, and independent learning
- Learn and implement new technologies
- Complete a product lifecycle from conception to delivery
- Utilize agile practices learned to assist in project completion

### Process Guidelines
- Use your product plan to lead the functionality development of your application
- Create and maintain a Trello board to document progress on your project
- Practice TDD to lead the development process

### Technical Guidelines
- Cover the requirements for technical [features](../capstone/features.md)
- Host the application using a VPS such as Amazon EC2
- Configure DNS with custom domain
- Expectations for code quality:
    - 90% or greater test coverage (backend code)
    - B- or greater score on Code Climate

### Deliverables
- [Project Concept](../capstone/concept.md)
- [Product Plan](../capstone/product-plan.md)

### Final Delivery
The Capstone Project consists of the following components:
- Completed application, live on the web
- The source code of your project on Github, with:
  - Clear documentation on how to setup/install your project
  - Any third-party dependencies or configuration required
  - A link to your Trello board
  - A link to your Product Plan
- [Product Plan](../capstone/product-plan.md): problem statement, user persona(s), market research
- [Project Presentation](../capstone/presentation.md), a demo of the application and pertinent information about your project
