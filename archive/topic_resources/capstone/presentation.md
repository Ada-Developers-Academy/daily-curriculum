# Capstone Presentation
The capstone presentation highlights your application as the culmination of your work at Ada.
It should be __no more than 5 minutes__ in length and should have the following components:

- What problem does the app solve? Who does it solve it for?
- What are 1-2 major features of the application, demoed from the eyes of a user?
- Optional: Exciting or interesting technologies you used
- Optional: What was one interesting technical challenge you overcame?
- Optional: Future enhancements

Prior to demoing, you should have the following:
- Each group should coordinate to use two computers for the demos in your group (first 3 or 4 people, and last 3 or 4 people). It would be best to choose one with an HDMI port.
- Dry run at least 2x prior to the demo, in front of someone else
- Know the sequence of events that you will execute to show the features you want to demo
- Prepare slides for any non-app talking points
