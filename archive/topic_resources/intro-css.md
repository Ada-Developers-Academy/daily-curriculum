# CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) exists to style your HTML for web, print, and more!

We use CSS to add layout and design to our page. We can also use CSS to share styles across websites and pages.

- There are a lot of CSS properties
- We will not get anywhere close to
covering all of them
- Practice the basics before getting fancy

## Anatomy of CSS

`selector { property: value; }`

- Selector is the thing you want to style
- Property is what aspect you want to style
- Value is how you want to style it
- Property + value = declaration
- Declarations end in semicolons (;)

## Selectors

There are a few different ways that we can select elements using CSS.
[W3Schools Selectors](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp)

## Common

**Font Properties**

- font-size: a number followed by a measurement of how tall the element's text is, usually in ems (em) or pixels (px)
- font-family: the name of a typeface, or typefaces
- font-style: italic
- font-weight: bold | values of bold!
- line-height: a number followed by a
measurement of how tall the element's line of is,
usually in ems (em) or pixels (px)

**Text Properties**

- text-align: left | right | center | justify
- text-transform: capitalize | uppercase | lowercase | some others
- text-decoration: underline | overline | line-through | some others
- Note: A lot of properties will take a value of none

**Colors**

- To set text colors, the property is color
- To set background colors, the property is background-color
- The value can be done a few ways:
  - Hex: #ff0000
  - RGB: rgb(255,0,0)
  - Also possible but not preferred: red
