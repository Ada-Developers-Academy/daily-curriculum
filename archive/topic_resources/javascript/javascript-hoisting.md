# Hoisting
We talked about this briefly last week with regards to functions, but let's talk about what this is overall with a little bit more detail.

What is hoisting? In JavaScript, hoisting refers to the process of "lifting" and declaring things prior to their explicit definition or declaration.

#### Ex 1
Let's see an example:
```javascript
function foo() {
  bar();
  var x = 1;
}
```

When we consider the way in which JavaScript will interpret this code, it would actually look more like this:
```javascript
function foo() {
  var x;
  bar();
  x = 1;
}
```

This becomes a more powerful example when we begin to combine our understanding of the way that Scope applies to functions in javascript and _not_ other blocks like `if` statements.
#### Ex 2
```javascript
function foo() {
  if (false) {
    var x = 1;
  }
  return;
  var y = 1;
}
```
The above example, when considering how the JavaScript interpreter works, would look like:
```javascript
function foo() {
  var x, y;
  if (false) {
    x = 1;
  }
  return;
  y = 1;
}
```

#### Ex 3
Now that we see that variable declaration is hoisted, we can also see the way we discussed last week where function declarations (but not expressions) are hoisted.

Let's see another example.
```javascript
function test() {
	foo(); // TypeError "foo is not a function"
	bar(); // "this will run!"
	var foo = function () { // function expression assigned to local variable 'foo'
		alert("this won't run!");
	}
	function bar() { // function declaration, given the name 'bar'
		alert("this will run!");
	}
}
test();
```

In the example above, the `foo` function _will not_ be hoisted because it is an **expression** not a **declaration**.
Function `bar` _will_ be hoisted because it is a **declaration**.
