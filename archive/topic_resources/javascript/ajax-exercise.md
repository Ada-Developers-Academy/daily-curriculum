# AJAX Exercise

With a person sitting near you, create a single page application that will load and display the data from [Socrata's Top 1000 Songs To Hear Before You Die](https://opendata.socrata.com/Fun/Top-1-000-Songs-To-Hear-Before-You-Die/ed74-c6ni).

### Start with:
- HTML file that will load
- JS file which will contain your code

### Goals:
- You will use AJAX to retrieve the data from this API
- You can decide how you want to display it on your screen
- Use Python's Simple HTTP Server to run a small web server on your local machine
  - This prevents issues with your browser thinking you are doing cross-site scripting
