## Problems

### Reverse an Array

#### Silver

Write a function that takes an array of numbers ```a```, and
returns an array with the elements of ```a``` in reversed
order. Use only ```Array#length``` and array indices for
array access. (In other words, no ```Array#reverse```,
```Array#<<```, ```Array#pop```, etc!)

#### Gold

Reverse the array in O(1) (constant) space, that is, don't
use more than a fixed number of additional variables,
regardless of the length of ```a```.

### Linked List Operations

#### Append List

Write a ```list_append``` function, that takes a linked
list ```l1``` and a linked list ```l2``` and returns a
linked list with ```l2``` appended to the end of ```l1```.
(Think ```l1``` + ```l2```).

#### Prepend List

Write a ```list_prepend``` function, that takes a linked
list ```l1``` and a linked list ```l2``` and returns a
linked list with ```l2``` prepended to the beginning of ```l1```.
(Think ```l2``` + ```l1```).

#### Insert List After Element

Write a method ```insert_after``` that takes a linked list
```l1```, a linked list ```l2```, and a value ```v```, and
inserts the list ```l2``` ***after*** the first occurance of
the value ```v``` in ```l1```.

#### Insert List Before Element

Write a method ```insert_before``` that takes a linked list
```l1```, a linked list ```l2```, and a value ```v```, and
inserts the list ```l2``` ***before*** the first occurance of
the value ```v``` in ```l1```.
