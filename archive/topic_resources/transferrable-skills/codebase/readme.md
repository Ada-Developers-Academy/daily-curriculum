# Foreign Codebase

This exercise is meant to give you exposure to using and working with a foreign code base. You may not know how to accomplish each step in this process, but that is OK! You should document, Google and use existing code to help you accomplish these tasks.

First, you will get the code set up, then you will fix some code and then you will add a new feature.

1. [Setup](setup.md)
2. [Fix a bug](fixing-a-bug.md)
3. [Add a new feature](new-feature.md)
