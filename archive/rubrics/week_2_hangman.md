### PROJECT LEARNING GOALS

| Rating | Content           | Description
|--------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
|        | Variables                | Variable names are logical, clear, and in snake case. Variables are not needlessly assigned or reassigned ([variable examples](#variables)).
|        | Loops                    | Loops control the flow of the code, keeping the user on track, and continuing the program until an appropriate end point.
|        | Strings                  | Strings are used and manipulated (compared, concatenated) correctly to prevent any errors in game scoring, game play, and drawing the board.
|        | Conditionals & Operators | Logical and mathematical operators guide program flow efficiently and properly deal with edge cases ([operator/conditional examples](#conditionals--operators)).
|        | Methods                  | Methods are designed and implemented with a single purpose. Methods are logically named in snake case.
|        | Classes                  | Classes are used to represent a single object, and contain all of the functionality and information associated with that object.

### Examples

#### Variables
```ruby
# Good:
post_height = 7.0
user_name = gets.chomp

# Bad:
p = 7
ph = '7.0'
postHeight = 77
```

#### Conditionals & Operators
```ruby
x = 2

# Good:
if x < 2
  result = "x is less than 2"
elsif x > 2
  result = "x is greater than 2"
else
  result = "x is exactly 2"
end

puts result

# Bad:
if x < 2
  result = "x is less than 2"
elsif x > 2
  result = "x is greater than 2"
end

puts result

```


### CODE QUALITY

| Rating | Skill          | Description
|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
|        | Correctness    | Code runs without errors or bugs. Edge cases are tested for and handled appropriately.
|        | Readability    | Formatting is consistent. Naming conventions are followed. Use of white space and tabs are consistent. Code is concise. Each group of statements creates a complete thought and those thoughts are separated by blank lines. Variable, method and class names are meaningful.
|        | Structure      | Methods perform one, and only one, function. Blocks of code that are run multiple times are not cut-and-pasted, but instead are written as loops and functions. Variables are not duplicated unnecessarily.
|        | Efficiency     | There is no unused code included.
|        | Comments       | Comments accurately describe code logic and are placed before or on the line they describe. Comments are either: information that canâ€™t be expressed in code, intent comments, or summary comments.
