### PROJECT LEARNING GOALS

| Rating | Content           | Description
|--------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
|        | Variables                | Variable names are logical, clear, and in snake case. Variables are not needlessly assigned or reassigned. Instance variables are used for visibility within all methods in the class. Local variables are used for visibility only to a single code block or method.  ([variable examples](#variables)).
|        | Loops                    | Loops control the flow of the code, keeping the user on track, and continuing the program until an appropriate end point.
|        | Data Types               | Hashes, arrays, strings, symbols, numbers, and booleans used appropriately. ([data type examples](#data-types))
|        | Conditionals & Operators | Logical and mathematical operators guide program flow efficiently and properly deal with edge cases ([operator/conditional examples](#conditionals--operators)).
|        | Methods                  | Methods are designed and implemented with a single purpose. Methods are logically named in snake case.
|        | Classes                  | Classes are used to represent a single object, and contain all of the functionality and information associated with that object.

### Examples

#### Variables
```ruby
# Good:
post_height = 7.0
user_name = gets.chomp

class Item
  def initialize(item_name)
    @item_name = item_name
  end
end

# Bad:
p = 7
ph = '7.0'
postHeight = 77

class Item
  @item_name = # Incorrect usage outside of a method in class scope
end

```

#### Conditionals & Operators
```ruby
x = 2

# Good:
if x < 2
  result = "x is less than 2"
elsif x > 2
  result = "x is greater than 2"
else
  result = "x is exactly 2"
end

puts result

# Bad:
if x < 2
  result = "x is less than 2"
elsif x > 2
  result = "x is greater than 2"
end

puts result

```

#### Data Types
```ruby
# Good:
name = "Bobbina"
honorific = "Ms. #{name}"

# Bad:
num = '2'
total = 1 + num.to_i
```

### CODE QUALITY

| Rating | Skill          | Description
|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
|        | Correctness    | Code runs without errors or bugs. Edge cases are tested for and handled appropriately.
|        | Readability    | Formatting is consistent. Naming conventions are followed. Use of white space and tabs are consistent. Code is concise. Each group of statements creates a complete thought and those thoughts are separated by blank lines. Variable, method and class names are meaningful.
|        | Structure      | Methods perform one, and only one, function. Blocks of code that are run multiple times are not cut-and-pasted, but instead are written as loops and functions. Variables are not duplicated unnecessarily.
|        | Efficiency     | There is no unused code included.
|        | Comments       | Comments accurately describe code logic and are placed before or on the line they describe. Comments are either: information that canâ€™t be expressed in code, intent comments, or summary comments.
