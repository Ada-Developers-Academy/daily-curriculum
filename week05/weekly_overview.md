# Week 5
In week 5 we will be learning the basics of HTML & CSS. By the end of the week we will style a single page website using the common HTML & CSS practices and deploy it to [Heroku](http://heroku.com). We will also rebuild a blog to implement as side pages to our single page site.

Our learning will focus on the usage of basic HTML tags and their potential attributes. We will learn about CSS selectors, cascading rules, and common techniques for creating important web page elements. By the end of the week students should be able to create and style a webpage using valid HTML and CSS.
