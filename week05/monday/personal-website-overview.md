## Personal Website Overview

- **Duration**: 3 days (then ongoing as desired)
- **Submission**: Your second blog post

In the Personal Website project, we will be using the [Sinatra Blog](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/daily-curriculum/blob/master/week04/wednesday/sinatra-blog.md) you created last week. We will be adding HTML content and styling with CSS to the [layout.erb](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/daily-curriculum/blob/master/week4/friday/sinatra_practice/views/layout.erb) page. The goal is to have a personal blog to promote yourself and/or to have fun.

1. Mock-up a website layout using common tools
2. Implement an HTML structure based on a mock-up using up-to-date practices.
