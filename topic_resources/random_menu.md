## Random Menu Generator

Bronze
------
Create a random menu generator that can be played from the Terminal.

Your code should use three arrays, each containing a different type of word or phrase you would associate with food. Your generator should pull one item from each array to create a "menu item".  

For example, you could have a list of adjectives, cooking styles and foods in order to create something like:  
+ hot pan-fried dumplings  
+ soft steamed clams  

Each array should contain ten items. When the program runs, it should create and show a list of ten different numbered menu items.
```ruby
1. hot pan-fried dumplings
2. soft steamed clams
3. ...
...
10. ...
```

Silver
------
Expand your solution to use __any__ number of menu items that you provided. So if you expand your arrays to contain 15 or 20 items, your program will show a list of 15 or 20 items. 

Gold
------
Expand your solution to ensure that no menu item is ever duplicated.
