Preparing for Capstone
-------------------
This weekend, take some time to outline your project. We want to have a good understanding of what the project is (problem statement), who it serves, and what features you plan to build. 

Please complete the following before Monday morning:

## Capstone Prep Document (on GitHub, written in Markdown)
- 1 paragraph project description and problem statement (what problem is your app solving?)
- 1-3 user personas: descriptions of the people who will use your product

## Capstone Pivotal Project
- Create a new project on Pivotal Tracker and invite Kerri, Bookis, and Elise
- Write 5-7 rough feature stories (these can be big, we will start to de-scope them on Monday)
