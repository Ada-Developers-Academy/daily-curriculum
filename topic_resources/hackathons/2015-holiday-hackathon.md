# 2015 Holiday Hackathon 
- Monday, December 21, 2015

## What's a hackathon?
- Hacking is creative problem solving.
- A hackathon is any event where people come together to solve problems. 

## Proper Culture
Hackathons should:
- Provide an opportunity to focus on team-work and solving a problem collaboratively.
- Be welcoming to the least experienced as well as the most experienced.
- Provide an opportunity for participants to learn something new.
- Provide a space and a time for participants to make headway on problems they are interested in.

Don’t expect to have actually solved a problem by the end of the hackathon. Some problems are hard! Think of the hackathon as a training session for solving problems on your own and an opportunity to learn as well as help others grow.

## What does a good project look like?
- **Clearly articulated and thought out.** Projects should have a clear question or problem they are trying to solve plus a reasonably specific proposed solution.
Attainable. Most projects will accomplish about 25% of what they think they can accomplish in the limited time they have. Manage each project’s goals so participants are able to feel accomplished at the end of the session, not interrupted.
- **Everyone should be able to participant.**. Projects should have ready-to-go tasks for perople with a variety of skill levels and interests. The project setup should be able to be spun up in less than 20 minutes. 
- **Led by a Task Master.** The task master guides the project. The task master’s role should be to coordinate the details of the project, ensuring each team member has something to work on and helping pieces come together fluidly.

## Hackathon Theme
For this Hackathon you will be creating a card game of your choice. You can utilize [`https://github.com/jdan/rubycards`](https://g
ithub.com/jdan/rubycards) to handle the creation of Cards and Decks.

## Basic Requirements
- This should be a card based game
- Everyone in the group should be participating
- There should be at least 1 way to win and 1 way to lose the game

## Baseline
- Pick a card game and research how to play
- Find or create a concise rules list for people to reference on how to play the game (website, youtube video, etc)
- Plan out a way to solve the problem - Create a trello board for all the tasks that need to be completed (but not how to solve each piece)
- Come up with a 30-second pitch on your game -- you will present this to the class and see if anyone wants to form a group to solve your proposed problem. Not everyone HAS to pitch thier idea, but everyone does have to plan out and think through a possible project. Remember that others make choose the same game as you, but propose a different way to solve the problem. **If your project is chosen, you should still be flexible enough to take input from your group and adjust the way the group tackles the project.

## Hack-a-thon!!
- Everyone pitches ideas
- Groups are formed (3-5 people per group)
- 1 subject-expert per group (TA or Instructor) who both codes and acts as Task Master
- Everyone hacks. 
- Everyone makes sure everyone is included -- both in voicing their opinions and contibuting code.
- Pair programming is OK, but everyone should drive at some point!

<!--
## Extensions
- Create an AI to play the game (smart or not -- A random AI is still AI!)
- Create a leader board to track high scores between games
- Put in an [Easter Egg](http://www.businessinsider.com/best-video-game-easter-eggs-ever-2014-7) in your game
