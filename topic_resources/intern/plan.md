# Internship Prep Plan

We will utilize internship prep time to prepare for internships with transferrable skills beyond what we had time to talk about in the classroom.

Part of the three weeks will be spent doing activities with the whole class, not necessarily directly related to your internship tech stack. Part of the time will be set up to maximize learning specific technologies, that are closest to your internship tech stack. We will not have time to cover every thing that every intern will use in three weeks.

## Overall Learning Goals
- Navigating a foreign code base
- Triaging bugs
- Exposure to a new programming language
- Configuring a new development environment
- And as always, comfort with the uncomfortable!

#### Other notes:
- We are back to normal hours 9-5
- You are welcome to meet with your intern companies during this time, please inform your instructors
- You are welcome to explore other topics that you will be exposed to during your internship during this time, but you are expected to accomplish the tasks for our overall learning goals
