# Algorithms!

### Research
In a group, work to research an important algorithm or set of algorithms and create a 5 minute presentation about it.

Your presentation should address the following points:
- History: Who developed this, when, where, and why?
- Usage: Who uses this algorithm today? Where is it useful?
- Implementation: What is the pseudocode of this algorithm? Demonstrate the algorithm visually, if possible (e.g. diagrams, animations) so that people can understand.
- How fast is this algorithm, or what is the complexity (Big O notation)?
