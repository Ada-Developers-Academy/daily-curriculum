# Getting Started Exercises

<!--Use the js-playground to write the code in these exercises. You will need to create modules in the src/ directory for your solutions to the exercises.-->

## Reverse an Array

JavaScript provides an Array.reverse method. For practice, we're going to write something similar. Neither solution should use the reverse method.

<!--Create a module in src/ called reverser.js. This file should export a JS object with methods that are the functions defined in the exercises.-->

### First

Write a function called reverseArray() that takes an array, `ar` as an argument and returns a new array that has the same elements as `ar`, but in inverted order. Add this function to your reverser module.

### Added fun!

Write a function called reverseArrayInPlace() that takes an array `ar` as an argument and returns the same array modified to have its elements in reverse order.

## Palindrome

Build a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns whether or not that string is a palindrome.
