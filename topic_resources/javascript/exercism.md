# Exercism

We will be using [Exercism](exercism.io) as a tool to assist in our learning of JavaScript. Exercism provides a number of practice problems along with unit tests to ensure the accuracy of your answer to the test problems.

## Setup
All of the Exercism exercises can be done from the comfort of your own command line. This will require some configuration and setup on your part.

1. Sign up on Exercism via GitHub
2. Install and Configure the Command Line Interface using [these instructions](http://exercism.io/cli).
3. Fetch the first exercise from the JavaScript track using [these instructions](http://exercism.io/languages/javascript). _No need to complete or submit the exercise. Fetching is sufficient for this step._
4. Be sure that your instructor adds you to your cohort's team on Exercism
