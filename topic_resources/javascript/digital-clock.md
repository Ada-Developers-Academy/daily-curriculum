# Digital Clock

### Create a digital clock in your browser!

### Getting Started
- Create a function which will do all of the work to calculate and show the time. Start by loading this function using the document ready.

  ```
  $(document).ready( function() {
    // your code here
  });
  ```

- Use the [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) Library in Javascript to retrieve the current date and time information. Use the different methods that are provided to you for retrieving the individual hour, minute and second information.
- Use the [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval) method to utilize the function you've created to update each second.

Your solution will include one CSS file which contains your page styles, one JS file which contains your clock logic and one HTML file which contains your page structure and loads the CSS and JS resources.

### Added fun!
- Update your clock to have world clock functionality which will show four different clocks in four different timezones of your choice
- Update your clock to show the full date with the day of the week, and the month, day and year
