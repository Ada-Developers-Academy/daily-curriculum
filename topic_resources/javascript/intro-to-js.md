# Basic JavaScript

We try to separate concerns in web applications:

* **HTML** - Document structure and information. Your HTML mark up should
  be a semantic representation of the information in your document.

* **CSS** - Presentation. CSS controls the way that we present our
  information to the user.

* **JavaScript** - Behavior and interactivity. We use JavaScript to handle
  user interactions via events, and to add interactivity to our web
  apps.
