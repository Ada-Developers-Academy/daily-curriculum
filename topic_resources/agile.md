# Agile
Agile developement is a set of methodologies that promotes adaptive, flexible,
and rapid development.

## Iterative vs Waterfall
Two (competing) ideas in creating software.

**Waterfall** (old school)

- Project focused
- Project time line many months to years.
- Testing phase after development phase

**Iterative** (agile)

- Product focused
- Project time several days to weeks.
- Testing integrated with development

## Stand Up
> Daily stand-up meetings have become a common ritual of many teams, especially in Agile software development. However, there are many subtle details that distinguish effective stand-ups and a waste of time.

Stand up is a daily meeting for a small team, typically at the same place and time each day.
During the meeting everyone meets standing up (get it?). Each team member takes 30-60 seconds to talk about three things:

1. What did I accomplish yesterday?
2. What will I do today?
3. What obstacles are impeding my progress?

The point is to keep is short and sweet. Do not:

1. Ask in-depth questions of others, instead quickly communicate a time to meet individually to talk.
1. Ramble.
1. Show up unprepared.

## User Stories
User stories are a way to define application requirements. Typically they are
written by a project manager or customer. The format of a user story varies
but is typically something like

```
As a <role>, I want <goal/desire>
```

- As a user, I want to search for my customers by their first and last names
- As an author, I want to start an application with the last edit.

For this project we'll be using a [Kanban Board](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)
system called [Trello](trello.com) to document and manage user stories.
