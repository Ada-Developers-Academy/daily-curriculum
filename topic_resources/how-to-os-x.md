# How to OS X

The mouse is slow, especially on a laptop. There are *tons* of hotkeys, tricks, and techniques, to make your usage fast and easy entirely from the keyboard. You will certainly learn many of these during your career, we'll start by learning just a few.

Keys
-------
- `⌘` (command)
- `⌥` (option/alt)
- `⌃` (control)
- `⇧` (shift)
- `fn` (function)
- `⇥` (tab)
- `↩` (return/enter)
- `␣` (space)

Hotkeys
-------
### Basics
- `⌘s` - save current file
- `⌘c` - copy current selection
- `⌘x` - cut and copy current selection
- `⌘v` - paste last copied content
- `⌘z` - undo last action (can use multiple times)
- `⌘⇧z` - redo last undo

### Cursor & Selection
- `⌘a` - select all contents of current window
- `⌘l` - select current line
- `⌘<directional arrow>` - Move cursor to maximum point in given direction
- `⌥<left or right arrow` - Move cursor one word in either direction
- `⇧<cursor movement command>` - select the content between start and end location of the cursor

### System Navigation
- `⌘w` - close the current tab (window if single tab)
- `⌘⇧w` - close the current window (all tabs)
- `⌘q` - quit the current application
- `⌘⇥` - switch applications, continue to hold `⌘` to display all open programs, each tap on `⇥` will switch to the next app. Use ⇧⇥ to switch to previous app.
- `⌘ backtick` - (backtick is below `esc`), switch windows in the current application, use ⇧ backtick to switch to previous window.
- `⌘␣` - open Spotlight. Spotlight is a tool to search applications, files, and perform some basic function like math and conversions

### Common Application Hotkeys\*
- `⌘⇧[` - move one tab to the left
- `⌘⇧]` - move one tab to the right
- `⌘⇧t` - open the last closed item
- `⌘f` - find, opens a panel to type a search term
- `⌘⇧f` - find all, searches all files (text editors only, Atom, Sublime)
- `⌘n` - open a new window (or file depending on the application)
- `⌘t` - open a new tab (includes file search in text editors)
- `⌘r` - reload page (Browsers only)
- `⌘,` - open settings pane
- `⌘/` - make selection or line a comment (text editors only)

\* Hot keys can be at the system level or specific to a certain application. Not all application will respond to these hotkeys, but the majority that we use (Terminal, major browsers, Atom, Sublime)

------

It takes some practice but after you use these enough, they will become intuitive. Many of the hotkeys I use, I couldn't tell you what they are, my hands just know how to do them.
Resources. Pick top 5 Hotkeys you'd like to use, and force yourself to use them.

Hotkeys can be added or changed under `Keyboard` in the OS X System Preferences
