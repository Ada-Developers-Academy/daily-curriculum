# Try your command line skills

Yes, you could do some of this stuff without the command line, but since we're practicing the command line, let's use that!

Before actually tackling this list and executing commands, first list out which commands you think you'll use for each task. Compare your list with someone else before you get hackin'.

1. [Go back in time](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/daily-curriculum/tree/ee543f7035dbc10f41850ba0804903ec98d26927) and download the Ada daily-curriculum repo as of Feb 2015
2. Rename the directory to `daily-curriculum-old`
3. Make a copy of the entire directory called `daily-curriculum-new`
4. Move all the files from `week/day/` to a new folder called `topic_resources`
5. Fix all the now-broken links to `topic_resources/*`
6. Remove all topic_resources that are not mentioned in any weekly_overview.md
7. Move stray files in `/` to `/topic_resources/` IFF they are actually referenced somewhere, otherwise, delete them.

### Optional Challenges
+ Move the contents of each `weekly_overview.md` into one file called `cohort_calendar.md`
+ Delete all the empty directories
+ Repeat this process for `intern_weeks/`

### Things you could fix on the real Ada daily-curriculum
+ Consistency with - or _ in file/folder names
+ UGH The table dividers not aligning on the cohort_schedules pages
+ There's probably more...
