# Problem Solving Approach

*(Adapted from G. Polya,* How to Solve It *)*

## Understand the problem.

*What is the unknown? What are the data? What is the condition?*

Is it possible to satisfy the condition? Is the condition sufficient
to determine the unknown?

Draw a picture! Separate the various parts of the problem.

## Devise a plan.

*Find the connection between the data and the unknown. Consider alternate problems!*

Have you seen the problem before? Have you seen the problem in a
slightly different form? Have you seen a solution to a problem that
you can use? Can you reuse the approach?

Restate the problem? Can you reformulate it?

If you can't solve the proposed problem, try to solve a related
problem! Can you imagine something similar but more accessible? Is
there a part of the problem that you can solve, or is there a
condition that you can drop to make the problem make more sense? Can
you solve this problem with a specific set of data? When you do, what
are the steps?

Write out each step of your plan in plain language.

## Carry out the plan.

Implement the plan by translating your plain language version into
code. *Check each step*. Be careful of details that may have been
hidden in your plain language version!

## Examine your solution.

Can you check the result? Can you check the arguments?
Can you derive the result differently?
Can you use the result for some other problem?
Step through your code with paper and pencil and trace the results at each step.
