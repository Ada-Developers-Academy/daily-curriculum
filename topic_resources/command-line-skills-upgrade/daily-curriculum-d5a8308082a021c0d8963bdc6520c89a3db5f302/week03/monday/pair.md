# Pair Programming Rules

### Share.
> "In pair programming, two programmers are assigned to jointly produce one artifact (design, algorithm, code, among others). ... One person is typing or writing [driving], the other is continually reviewing the work [navigating]. ... Both partners own everything."

Not only is this an effective learning technique, it is also more productive than splitting a task in two, working on each half separately, and then combining the two.

### Play fair.
It is important to take turns typing or writing [driving], so that the other person gets a chance to review [navigate].

### Clean up.
Defects belong to the pair. Having two sets of eye balls is much better than one.

### Hold hands and stay together.
All programming should be done together; do not create things done alone. The literature of pair programming shows that most defects are traceable to things done singly. It also inhibits learning.

### Say you're sorry.

>"Ego-less programming ... is essential for effective pair programming."

Do not insist on having things your way or else. Do not get defensive about criticism. Work things out as a pair.
