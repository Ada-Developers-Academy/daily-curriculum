Let's make a planetary system!
------------------------------

Bronze
-------
- Create a Planet class with a name attribute
- Create a SolarSystem class that has an attribute "planets" that has 0-??? Planets
- Each element with the `planets` Array should be a `Planet` object
- Get creative! Give planets diameters, mass, moons.. whatever! Allow these attributes to be set using a hash in initialize.

Silver
------
- Give your solar system a formation date (in earth years).
- Give each planet a rate of solar rotation
- Define a method that returns the local year of the planet based on it's rotation since the beginning of the solar system

Gold
------
- Write a program that asks for user input to query the planets
    - Which planet would you like? (list planets)
    - What would you like to know about the planet? (give options, diameter, mass, number of moons)

Platinum
--------
- Give each planets a `@distance_from_the_sun` attribute, and a method to determine the distance from any other planet (assuming planets are in a stright line from the sun)
