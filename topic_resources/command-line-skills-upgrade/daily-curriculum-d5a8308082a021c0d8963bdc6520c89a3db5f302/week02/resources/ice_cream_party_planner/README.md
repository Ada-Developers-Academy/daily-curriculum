Ice Cream Party Planner
=======================

Write a script that allows user(s) to enter in their favorite ice cream flavors.

When done entering users and flavors, the script should print the flavors in alphabetical order.

Next Steps:
 + have the user enter a party invitee's name as well as their favorite flavor

 + ask the user what kind of "report" they'd like about the party, such as
   + print out an alphabetical list of invitee's along with their favorite flavor
   + print out an alphabetical list of flavors along with the names of the users who liked that flavor. For Example:

   ```ruby
   Chocolate: Sally, Susan, Sam
   Rocky Road: Billy Jo, Alex
   Vanilla: Micah, Fred, Barry, Melissa
   ```

### extra credit
  + allow user to enter more than one flavor for each users
  + adjust the reports to accommodate multiple flavors
  + add a new report that shows the most popular flavors, and the number of people who liked each one
