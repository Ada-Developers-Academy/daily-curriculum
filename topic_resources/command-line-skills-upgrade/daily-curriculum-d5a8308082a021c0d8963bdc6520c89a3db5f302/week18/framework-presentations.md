#Framework Lightning Talks

On Friday afternoon, instead of working on your projects or having lecture time,
every student will give a lightning talk on topic related to front-end frameworks. The
purpose for this is three-fold:

- Allow students to explore things that interest them the most
- Share the information from this exploration with their classmates
- Practice giving presentations about tech in a low-pressure environment to a friendly audience

Consider this your homework this week.

This is NOT meant to be a big huge research project. This is meant to allow you to explore
what interests you and to present the results of this exploration to your classmates. I expect
you to spend a few hours working on this presentation over the course of a week--we're
talking 1-3 here, not 10-30.

##Specs
- Should have a [Google Docs presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation) (this is similar to PowerPoint)
    - A link to this Google Docs presentation should be emailed to Ellen by ten on Friday
    - Doesn't have to have a bajillion beautiful pictures or custom font or anything
    - Should aid your presentation, not distract from it
    - Cat/dog/dinosaur pictures are a plus, provided they don't squish relevant info off the page
- Time:
    - Groups of 1: 5-7 minutes
    - Groups of 2: 7-11 minutes
    - Groups of 3: 11-15 minutes
- Info covered should be a brief outline of the issue you are discussing with enough information to
    - BS my way through an interview
    - Know what to Google in the bathroom at a networking event
    - Have a general impression about whether I (the listener) might want to pursue that issue
- Appropriately complex/simple information for your classmates as an audience
- Be prepared to answer some simple questions from classmates about your topic
    - No one expects you to be an expert. It's okay if your answers are "I don't know"
- Email me or talk with me by Wednesday with any concerns

On Friday, starting at 12pm, we'll watch the presentations and learn from each other.
We'll spend the rest of our class time in this way.
