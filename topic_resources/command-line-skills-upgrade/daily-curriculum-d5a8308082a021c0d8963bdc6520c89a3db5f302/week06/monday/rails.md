Rails is a DSL
==============

Rails, like Sinatra, is a DSL for creating web pages.

Fully open-source, it is constantly adapting to new trends and requirements of modern web development.

Creating a New Rails Project
============================

```bash

rails new rails-blog -T -d postgresql

cd rails-blog/
```


What Happened?
==============

The Rails gem includes a command-line tool ```rails``` that has a number of options. With it we can start a server, quickly create new classes, or work with the database, among others. The command ```new``` creates a new directory and creates all the subdirectories and files a Rails application needs to have in order to get started.

What's Inside?
==============

Let's take a tour!


Starting A Rails Server
=======================

<pre>$ rails server</pre>

This command starts the default web server ```WEBrick``` which we can access at http://localhost:3000 on our computer. It will display the output of the log, showing all the errors, warnings, and notifications generated by the app, all the DB queries, and some basic timing information. Let's take a look at that!

Notes
--------

- `rails new rails-blog -T -d postgresql`
    - `-T` excludes the default test framework (always use this, even if using rspec)
    - `-d postgresql` specifies to use the postgresql database

- bundle install
- rake db:create
- git init
- git commit
- Create a Controller
- Create a Route
- Define an action
- Create a view dir
- Create a index file
- Fill file with content
- Look at application.html.erb
- git commit
- Remove turbo links. Why?
    - Gemfile
    - application.html.erb (two places)
    - application.js
- bundle install (because we removed something from Gemfile)
- git commit
- Create a Post model
- rake db:migrate, why?
- Look at model class
- Create a object in console
- Add all posts in index
- Create a new
- Add a form
- Create a create action
- Redirect to index
- Sign in
