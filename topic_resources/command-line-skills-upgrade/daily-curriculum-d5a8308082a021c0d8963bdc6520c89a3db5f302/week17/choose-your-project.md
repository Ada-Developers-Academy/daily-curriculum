Choose Your Project
-------------------
This week is an opportunity to return to basics, work on side projects, or experiment with a tool or technique you haven't had the opportunity to explore yet. All projects will be documented through a variety of options.

## Goals
- prepare for capstone project
- identify areas for extra study
- practice self-organized learning habits
- practice technical communication skills

## Expectations
- demonstrate self-direction, time management, and independent learning
- by the following Monday morning, have produced one of the following:
    - technical blog post
    - class presentation
    - lightning talk for local user group
    - short screencast video

## What should I build?!?

First brainstorm some ideas for your capstone project, the ideas can be loose and unclear, this project is about refining. Once you decide on a project (or two) that interests you, do some research, white board, and run it by your classmates. Next, determine if there is any part of your project that you currently are unsure how to technically implement. These are the pieces that you will want to focus and present on for this project.

On top of features which may be unclear to you, you may also decide to use a different language or Framework, here are some options:

- A Ruby command line tool
- A Sinatra application
- Using Python
    - [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) (similar to Sinatra)
    - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (similar to Rails)
- Using Javascript
    - There are tons of frameworks, compare them [here](http://todomvc.com/)
- Use a library to build something other than a web app
    - Anything physical with your [Edison](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html)
    - A 2D game with [Gosu](http://www.libgosu.org/)
- Or of course a Rails app
