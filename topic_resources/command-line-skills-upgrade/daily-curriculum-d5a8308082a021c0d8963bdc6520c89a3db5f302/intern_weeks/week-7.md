# Week 7 of Internships

| Time       | Topic |
|:----------:|:--------------------------------:|
|1:00 - 4:00 | [Review Applications](http://application.adadevelopersacademy.org)*     |
|1:00 - 4:00 | Open Work Hours   |
|4:00 - 5:00 | Retro   |

*As of 6/18 we have completed 598 reviews, I estimate that we will need to complete
about 1,000 to have full coverage (~5 reviews/submission) for round 1. If everyone completes 33
additional reviews we will be done!

After completing reviews (or if you've completed > 100 already) then feel free to work
on anything you want. Some students have asked for the opportunity to pair and get
help on problems they are having, this kind of in-class free time is *always* a
good time for this kind of work. Alternately you can work on the project listed below.

### Language Primer
Write a primer for future students who may be learning the language and/or frameworks
that you are currently learning. Include:

- Layperson introduction with some of the specs, strengths, and use cases
- Resources for installation and getting started
- "Hello World" tutorial of the language
- A list of common problems or errors that were difficult to understand or find solutions (be very specific)
- Anything that you wish someone would have told you before you started.

To get started clone the Ada [repo](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/primers).
Create a new markdown file for the topic that you want to write about, the name
of the file should be descriptive of what you are covering `python-django.md`.
Feel free to push your file up at any time. If there are conflicts in file names,
then please rename your file being more specific or simply putting a `-2` at the end.
