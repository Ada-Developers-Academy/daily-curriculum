# ￼FLOW CONTROL### true and false, if and else.`true` and `false` are unique objects (technically instances of `TrueClass` and `FalseClass`)They are the result of comparison operators- `>` Greater than?- `>=` Greater than or equal to?- `<` Less than?- `<=` Less than or equal to?- `==` Equal?- `!=` Not equal?```ruby1 > 0# => true"hello" == "hello"# => true```## Conditionals`if` and `else` allow you to control the flow of your program. The concept is pretty simple,read the following, you should be able to get a good idea of what the program will do```rubyputs "Hey! What’s your name?"response = gets.chompif response.downcase == 'computer'  puts "Weird, that's my name too. Small world!"else  puts "Wacky name!"endputs "Well, it was nice to meet you #{response}."```
