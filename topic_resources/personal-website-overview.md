## Personal Website Overview

#### Breakfast

- **Duration**: 3 days (then ongoing as desired)
- **Submission**: Your second blog post

In the Personal Website project, we will be using the [Sinatra Blog](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/daily-curriculum/topic_resources/sinatra-blog.md) you created last week. We will be adding HTML content and styling with CSS to the [layout.erb](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/daily-curriculum/topic_resources/sinatra_practice/views/layout.erb) page. The goal is to have a personal blog to promote yourself and/or to have fun.

#### After this project you will be able to:

1. Mock-up a website layout using common tools.
2. Implement an HTML structure based on a mock-up using up-to-date practices.
3. Learn and practice the implementation of the most common HTML Tags.
4. Link to separate CSS files.
5. Style a webpage using basic CSS techniques.
