# Team Project Contributions

The previous break project had each individual create a project of their liking. Now, you will enhance your project as well as contributing to another project!

## Setup your Project for Contribution
1. Ensure your `README` is up to date. This should include the details about your application, why it was built, what the purpose is. Any details that would be important for someone who wants to contribute to your project.
1. Ensure you have a `.ruby-version` and `.ruby-gemset` file configured to allow anyone to set up your development environment.
1. Ensure your latest and greatest code base is on the `master` branch.
1. Utilize [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to track features and bugs that you think you should include in your application. Utilize the labels to denote which type of issue it is (bug or enhancement).
  - Note: Many of these should include integrating RSpec tests for your models and controllers



## Your Project
These tasks should be completed on your project. You should utilize the GitHub Issues and pull-request process for yourself to avoid any overlaps or conflicts with anyone who will collaborate on your project. When you are working on one of the issues you have created, please assign it to yourself.

### Tasks
1. Deploy to Heroku
1. Integrate RSpec for model and controller testing

### Continuous
1. Watch your Issue comments for collaborators to assign issues to them
1. Watch your notifications for pull requests from collaborators. Review the contents of the pull request and make change recommendations in order to feel comfortable merging

## Contribute
These are the steps you should complete to contribute to another person's project.
1. Review a few open issues on a few different student's projects. This will help you get a feel for what types of things you can potentially work on.
  - Feel free to fork and run anyone's projects to get an idea for what they have thus far
1. Once you decide which project you want to work on, create a fork.  
  - On your fork create a branch that corresponds to the issue that you will be working on.
1. Comment on the GitHub Issue you will be working on so the project owner can add you as a collaborator and assign the specific issue to you.
1. Issue a pull request from your fork back to the project's master project and branch for the project owner to review.
  - Watch your pull request notifications for responses from the project owner. They may recommend changes or simply merge your PR if the changes are satisfactory.
