# Team Project Contributions

The previous break project had each individual create a project of their liking. Now, you will enhance your project as well as contributing to another project!

## Setup your Project for Contribution
1. Ensure your `README` is up to date. This should include the details about your application, why it was built, what the purpose is. Any details that would be important for someone who wants to contribute to your project.
1. Ensure you have a `.ruby-version` and `.ruby-gemset` file configured to allow anyone to set up your development environment.
1. Ensure your latest and greatest code base is on the `master` branch.
1. Utilize [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to track features and bugs that you think you should include in your application. Utilize the labels to denote which type of issue it is (bug or enhancement).
  - Note: Many of these should include integrating RSpec tests for your models and controllers
