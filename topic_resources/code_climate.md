Code Climate
------------

One of the requirements for the capstone project is

```
B- or greater score on Code Climate
```

Code Climate bills itself as an "automated code review" tool. What it does is use code metric tools to analyze a github repo for common code problems using these metrics:

+ complexity
+ churn
+ duplication
+ code smells

It then generates a report card for your project, listing the problems it found, and giving some general advice on how to address those issues. 

Code Climate is free for public repos and OSS on Github.
