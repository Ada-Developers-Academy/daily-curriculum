## Job Advice from Kari
### First Days on the Job

What will the first several days/weeks of your internship look like?
- **Don't expect to be writing code right away**
- **Environment Setup**
  - This includes, access to systems, accounts, etc. 99% of the time, they cannot set this stuff up before the day you start.
  - Follow all instructions to the T (if they give you documentation)
  - Document any errors or issues you have using screenshots - especially if you don't have someone on hand immediately to get help
  - _Don't be surprised if it takes a long time to get access to the systems and servers you need_. Oftentimes these things rely on other teams that have a lot of competing priorities.
- **Reading**
  - Ask for any and all documentation, anything and everything you can find
  - Read things even if they don't seem to make sense; jot down notes and questions to ask.
- **Processes and Tools**
  - Expect to have to learn processes and tools which can often be as difficult to learn as a new programming language
  - Isolate the different items you need to learn to try to avoid getting overwhelmed
    - build system vs. version control vs. communication vs. bug tracking vs. IDE
  - If you're not sure which tools and processes are the most important, ask someone else to help you prioritize
    - Note that some things just take time and use to get the hang of
- Keep a running list of **terms, acronyms and phrases** that you don't understand
  - Either ask when you first hear them if you feel comfortable, or ask offline
  - Write this down!
- (Strictly My Style) **Take copious notes**
  - Catalog them to refer back
  - You won't remember everything you're told right away, but if you document things, you can refer back to them more easily
  - This will help you avoid asking a similar or same question multiple times
- Get a feeling for how **communication** within the team happens
  - Mostly virtual i.e. Slack?
  - Email?
  - Meetings?
  - Once you figure out the preferred communication method, then you need to figure out how these things work for you.
    - I regularly created draft e-mails that were saved in my inbox when I can up with questions. I would keep appending to this list until I felt like I had enough information and enough questions (a.k.a. a maximum number) before I sent a message.
- Get a feeling for how often you'll be able to communicate with your manager and/or mentor.
  - Do they want to tag up with you daily?
  - Are they super busy and need to use e-mail for communication?
    - **My Experience w/ Email vs. IM**
    - Assume e-mail responses will take time and do not get worked up about delayed responses
    - _If it is something that you don't think can wait for a response, don't send it via e-mail_
    - Be thoughtful about the priority of this communication prior to choosing your communication method
- **Do not wait to ask for help**
  - Your co-workers don't know what you need help with unless you ask
  - determine on what schedule your manager and/or mentor seem to be available for assistance
    - If they seem overwhelmed with your questions, create an opportunity for them to tell you how they would prefer you ask your questions
    - Note: Most of the time, they aren't upset with you asking questions, they're just trying to prioritize other things going on at the same time.

### Final Notes
- **You manage your experience at your internship**
  - Ada is here to support you when you need but it is your responsibility to manage your relationships with coworkers and day-to-day interactions
  - Give yourself attainable goals and track them
- **Don't Forget** that you are now the lowest person in the ranks. This is not to make you feel bad, but rather to help you manage expectations.   
  - Your company has a lot of priorities to juggle, and try to be realistic about where your needs fall into those priorities
