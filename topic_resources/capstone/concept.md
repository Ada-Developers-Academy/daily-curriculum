# Capstone Concept
The first deliverable for the capstone project is the initial concept. This is your first opportunity to share your capstone ideas and research with your instructor.

You should complete this exercise for any ideas that are still in consideration at the time that it is due. You should have __no more than three ideas__ at this stage.

## Concept Components
1. __Problem Statement__: A clear, concise statement describing the problem your project will solve.
1. __Draft Feature Set__: A detailed outline of all major feature sets that will result in the minimum viable product
1. __Draft Technology Choices__: This does not need to be final, but you should have an idea of which of [these](./features.md) technologies you would like to use to accomplish this project

## Format
Since most of the capstone deliverables will be included in your final repository, please create this document in markdown format.
