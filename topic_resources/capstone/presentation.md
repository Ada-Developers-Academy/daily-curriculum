# Capstone Presentation
The capstone presentation highlights your application as the culmination of your work at Ada. 
It should be <b>no more than 5 minutes</b> in length and should have the following components: 

- What problem does the app solve? Who does it solve it for?
- What are 1-2 major features of the application, demoed from the eyes of a user?
- What was one technical challenge you overcame? 

Prior to demoing, you should have the following:
- Provide URLs to the first person presenting in your group; ensure you have credentials for accounts accessible
- Dry run at least 2x this weekend, preferably in front of someone else
- Know the features you'll demo; have test accounts/items working
- Prepare slides for any non-app talking points (optional)
