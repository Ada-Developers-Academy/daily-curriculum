# Capstone Presentation
The capstone presentation highlights your application as the culmination of your work at Ada.
It should be __no more than 5 minutes__ in length and should have the following components:

- What problem does the app solve? Who does it solve it for?
- What are 1-2 major features of the application, demoed from the eyes of a user?
- What was one technical challenge you overcame?

Prior to demoing, you should have the following:
- Dry run at least 2x prior to the demo, in front of someone else
- Know the sequence of events that you will execute to show the features you want to demo
- Ensure you have test accounts/items working
- Prepare slides for any non-app talking points (optional)
