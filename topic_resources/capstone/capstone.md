# Capstone Project
The Capstone Project is the largest undertaking you'll experience in the Ada classroom. Not only is it a month long, but you will be your own product owner. It will be up to you to decide (with input from instructors, mentors, and TAs) what gets built when (and how).

### Teams
For the capstone project, you have the option to work individually or in a pair. If you do decide to work individually, you will have another individual with whom you will work with throughout the capstone as a sounding board and support system even though you will be working on different projects.

### Goals
- Teach yourself new technologies
- Complete a product lifecycle from conception to delivery
- Utilize agile practices learned to assist in project completion

### Process Guidelines
- Use your product plan to lead the functionality development of your application
- Create and maintain a Trello board to document progress on your project
- Practice TDD to lead the development process

### Technical Guidelines
- Host the application using a VPS such as Amazon EC2
- Configure DNS with custom domain
- Create a stylized, responsive design for all devices (phone, tablet, display)
- Use background jobs for any long running tasks (email, image processing, 3rd party data manipulation)
- Use caching for slow or bulky database interactions
- Use performance analytics to asses and optimize site performance (average server response time < 300ms)
- Integrate email (At least user signup)
- Expectations for code quality:
    - 90% or greater test coverage (models and controllers)
    - Javascript tests (client and server side) w/ Mocha
    - B- or greater score on Code Climate
    - No security issues (Brakeman)

### Final Delivery
The Capstone Project consists of the following components:
- Completed application, live on the web
- The source code of your project on Github, with:
  - Clear documentation on how to setup/install your project
  - Any third-party dependencies or configuration required
  - A link to your Trello board
  - A link to your Product Plan
- [Product Plan](../capstone/product-plan.md): problem statement, user persona(s), market research
- [Project Presentation](../capstone/presentation.md), a demo of the application and pertinent information about your project
