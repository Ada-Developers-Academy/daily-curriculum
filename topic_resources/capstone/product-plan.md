# Capstone Product Plan
One of the deliverables for the capstone is your product plan. This is your first opportunity to share your capstone idea and research with your instructor.

## Product Plan Components
1. __Problem Statement__: A clear, concise statement describing the problem your project will solve.
1. __Market Research__: Outline the key insights from your research, including:
  - your applicationâ€™s competition - what alternatives are already out there (competing apps and/or non-app solutions)
  - research from users on why these alternatives do not effectively address the problem.
  - differentiation: what makes your idea/product different
1. __User Personas__: A summary of your main target user group(s). What are their key characteristics? How do those characteristics factor into project/app/idea?
1. __Optional__:
  - Team information
  - Trello Board
  - Technology selections
  - Wireframes

## Format
Since the Product Plan is part of your final deliverable and should be included in your repository, it would be easiest to do this initial draft in a markdown format for easy transferability to GitHub.
