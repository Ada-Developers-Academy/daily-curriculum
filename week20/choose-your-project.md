Choose Your Project
-------------------
This week is an opportunity to return to basics, work on side projects, or experiment with a tool or technique you haven't had the opportunity to explore yet. All projects will be documented through a variety of options.

## Goals
- prepare for capstone project
- identify areas for extra study
- practice self-organized learning habits
- practice technical communication skills

## Expectations
- demonstrate self-direction, time management, and independent learning
- by the following Monday morning, have produced one of the following:
    - technical blog post
    - class presentation
    - lightning talk for local user group
    - short screencast video

## What should I build?!?
Here's some suggestions:

- A small Ruby or Rails app that acts as a spike for the capstone project
- Work through a Python tutorial and build a small Flask or Django application
    + Alternatively, work through a couple chapters of Seven Language in Seven Weeks
- Explore databases (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7560883/ebooks/seven-databases-in-seven-weeks_p2_0.pdf)
- Work on your own JS project, either in Ember or in a different framework
