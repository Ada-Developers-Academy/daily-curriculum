# Week 20

In Week 20 we will spend the week cleaning our palate before we begin the final 4 week capstone project. This week is an opportunity to return to basics, work on side projects, or experiment with a tool or technique you haven't had the opportunity to explore yet. All projects will be documented through a variety of options.

## Goals

- prepare for capstone project
- identify areas for extra study
- practice self-organized learning habits
- practice technical communication skills
