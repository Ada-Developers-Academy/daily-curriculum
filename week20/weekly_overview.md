# Week 20

In Week 20 we begin [capstone projects](../capstone/capstone.md). In this week
we will have lectures on relevant topics for a wide variety of capstone
requirements. Students will have frequent checkins with an instructor to ensure
the project is on track, review stories, and consult on any problems.

## Goals

- prepare for capstone project
- identify areas for extra study
- practice self-organized learning habits
- practice technical communication skills
