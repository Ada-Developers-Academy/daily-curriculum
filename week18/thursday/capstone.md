# Ada Developers Academy App Challenge Submission Guidelines 
**Deadline**: April 23rd, 2014 at 5pm

In alignment with the Apps for Good App Challenge, Ada Developers Academy (Ada) has developed an App Challenge as the capstone of the Ada class. The Ada Developers Academy App Challenge is similar to the Apps for Good challenge, but has a heavier focus on the technical aspects of app development. Ada Developers Academy student teams will be required to prototype their apps in addition to creating the business plan and mockups as required in the Apps for Good App Challenge.

### Delivery
The Ada Developers Academy App Challenge has a number of deliverables:

+ Completed Application, live on the web
+ Linked from the application, the following supplemental material:
    + Market Research
    + Problem Statement
    + User Personas (no more than 1000 words total)
+ Elevator Pitch Video (no more than 2 minutes long, uploaded to YouTube or Vimeo and available publicly)


###Assignments

1. **Problem Statement**
A clear, concise statement describing the problem your app will solve 

2. **Market Research**
Outline the key insights from your research 
Key insight should cover: your application’s competition: what alternatives are already out there (competing apps and/or non-app solutions) and research from users on why these alternatives do not effectively address the problem 
Each insight should include the following: an assumption statement, research method, insight statement and corresponding data 

3. **User Personas** 
A detailed summary of your main target user groups. 
How many are there? Niche audience or mass market? What are their key characteristics (age, lifestyle, etc.)

4. **Elevator pitch video** 
You've just stepped into an elevator with a VIP who could potentially invest in your app. You have one minute on the way up to convince them: how would you sell your app? 


## Application

### Overview
Teams of 3 students will use modern technologies and practices to implement the solution to the business plan documented above into a Rails application. Teams will select from at least two technical requirements and at least two integrations to implement within their application. The team will also use the market research, user personas, and wireframes to lead the functionality development of their application. 

### Goals
+ Create a fully functional and bug-free application that fulfills the “advanced features” and “integrations” requirements
+ Safe & secure application
+ Host the application using a VPS such as Linode.com.
+ Create a stylized design for all devices (phone, tablet, display)
+ Integrate email delivery
+ Use background jobs for any long running tasks (email, image processing, 3rd party data manipulation)
+ Use caching for slow or bulky database
+ Use performance analytics to asses and optimize site performance (average server response time < 300ms)
+ Obtain > 90% test coverage
+ At least a “B-“ grade using the [Code Climate](http://codeclimate.com) service


### Guidelines
+ Work together to plan and document their application
+ The application should have at least 10 items of dummy-data for each concept
+ Use [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com) as a project management service
+ Practice TDD to lead the development process

### Technical Implementation 
+ Fully-functional features as defined by the problem statement and market research
+ At least two complex integrations, for example:
    + External API
    + OAuth
    + Workers
    + NoSql
    + CDN
    +  Payment Processing
+ Two advanced features, for example:
    + SSL
    + CMS
    + Internationalization
    + Live Events
    + SOA
    + S3 storage/delivery
    + Secure API
+ Responsive Design
+ Email (At least user signup)
+ Meets expectations for code quality
    + > 90% test coverage
    + B- or greater score on Code Climate 
    + No security issues
+ Configure DNS with custom domain

## Judging Criteria

Judges will also be looking across the student team’s whole project to see if they have considered the following questions (where applicable). 

### Problem Definition 

+ Is the scenario the team is attempting to address clear and well thought out? 
+ How is the problem being solved, if at all? 


### Understanding Users 
+ What are the team’s specific target markets? 
+ Has the team understood their target users and their needs in a credible and thorough way?


### Understanding the market 
+ Has the team considered and adequately differentiated from competing apps or alternative solutions to the problem? 
+ What is the unique selling point of the app? 


### Data feasibility 
+ How was research conducted? Is it sound, with sufficient breadth, depth, and credibility?


### Software development
+ Does the code have over 80% test coverage? 
+ Is the Code Climate score B- or greater? 
+ Is code well-factored and easy to understand?


### User Experience
+ Are page load times under 300ms? 
+ Is user experience clear and understandable?
