# Capstone Project

The Capstone Project is the largest undertaking you'll experience in the Ada classroom.

Not only is it a month long, but you will be your own product owner and project manager. Before building your applications, you will need to create a product plan: you'll need to identify your target audience and their unmet needs. Then, you'll need to write a project specification to explain how you will meet those needs, including the features you intend to implement.

## Delivery
The Capstone Project is due by 5pm on Thursday, April 24th. It consists of the following components:

+ Completed application, live on the web
+ Linked from the application, the following supplemental material:
    + Product plan: problem statement, user persona(s), market research
+ Project presentation, including a demo of the application and product plan (to be presented last day of class)

## Product Plan Components

1. **Problem Statement**
A clear, concise statement describing the problem your app will solve.

2. **Market Research**
Outline the key insights from your research. Key insight should cover: your applicationâ€™s competition - what alternatives are already out there (competing apps and/or non-app solutions) and research from users on why these alternatives do not effectively address the problem.

3. **User Personas**
A detailed summary of your main target user group(s). What are their key characteristics?

## Application

### Overview
You may work as an individual or as a pair on your capstone project. To meet the technical requirements, you will need to meet all of the goals and guidelines listed below, as well as include at least two advanced features and at least two integrations within your application.

### Goals
+ Use your product plan to lead the functionality development of their application
+ Safe & secure application
+ Host the application using a VPS such as Linode.com (no Heroku)
+ Create a stylized, responsive design for all devices (phone, tablet, display)
+ Integrate email delivery
+ Use background jobs for any long running tasks (email, image processing, 3rd party data manipulation)
+ Use caching for slow or bulky database
+ Use performance analytics to asses and optimize site performance (average server response time < 300ms)
+ At least 10 items of dummy-data for each concept
+ Use [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com) as a project management service
+ Practice TDD to lead the development process
+ Email (At least user signup)
+ Meet expectations for code quality
    + 90% or greater test coverage
    + B- or greater score on Code Climate
    + No security issues
+ Configure DNS with custom domain

### Integration Choices
+ At least two complex integrations:
    + External API
    + OAuth
    + Workers
    + NoSql
