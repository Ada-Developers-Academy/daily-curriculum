# Digistore

In this project we will be building an ember.js appliction using a service backed
data source. The application will focus on building a multi-model commerce site,
first focusing on digital (no shipping) items.

We will utilizing the majority of ember.js's major features including RESTful models,
Controllers, Routes, Templates, and Helpers.

Students will work on individual applications, but they will be in a "co-worker"
pair to communicate about problems, techniques, and progress. And even pair program
to resolve difficult issues or large tasks.
