# Week 22

In Week 22 we continue [capstone projects](../capstone/capstone.md). In this week we will have 2 guest lectures on relevant topics for a wide variety of capstone requirements. Students will have regular checkins with an instructor to ensure the project is on track, review stories, and consult on any problems.

Lecture topics include:
+ Internationalization (i18n)
+ Revisting EC2

## Goals

+ Continue development of Capstone project
+ Discover gaps in learning and identify resources to fill them in
+ Code!
