# Retrospective

In Agile teams retrospectives will occur after a "sprint". The group leader should facilitate
identifying 3 answers to each of the following three questions:

1. What worked well
2. What didn't work well
3. What could help improve next time

Group leaders include in your email to Bookis notes from this retro.
